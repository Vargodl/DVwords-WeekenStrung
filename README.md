April 3rd

I just started a new, separate thread holding the pictures from Margie's party, which you can goto if you select the "Vargodl" at the top left of this page.

Today was a further 'returning to our "new" reality--home with an increasing sense of technological home security.  Margie may have mentioned that we had 'bigfoot' apparently come to visit us (aka case the joint) a couple of weeks ago. courtesy of snowfall, we saw his yeti tracks and became concerned about security--we have many windows (although new, secure and casement) and doors which are protective, but wont keep out someone with the need to enter.

Over the past weeks since biggie oggled, we've significantly upgraded our security--now with motion detectors, lights, videocameras, sirens as well as central monitoring (re-initiated) and non-denomininational space lasers which remotely inject Bill Gates' most uptodate-but excruciatingly painful, GPS tracking chips into the buttocks (and, in fact, the bollocks, if they are present) of unwanted uninvited visitors.

Security is important especially as we occasionally leave our kitties over night though we have the capability to see them on the little remote screen now.

We are very fortunate to have some nice stuff and live in one of the safest places around Boston.  Nonetheless, "some nice stuff" sometimes attracts the riff and the raff.  But we don't want to be owned by our possessions.

2 April

Recently back from NYC and a quick but very pleasant and (if I might say so) very successful surprise weekend for Margie. I am so very grateful for all who came to the city to share. It was inconvenient for everyone but I think everyone had a great time and would do it again. I am so especially grateful to Winston for helping to make it happen. 

Margie and I love each other very much and made the new vow to "never not" love each other.

1 April--April Enchantment (instead of Fools) Day

A wonderful surprise for my fantastic wife. 

Dinner with dear friends Pauline, Louie, Kevin, Abdu, Joanne, Jess, Rich, Stephanie, Stuart as well as Win (who was instrumental in planning and arranging) at Emilio's Balotto in NYC. 

As Scott Galloway says, Life is so rich!

And...as has been increasingly stated, close friends are very important to health and longevity. 

We are blessed with wonderful friends. 

...And, I dearly love my wife. I surprised her today for the wonderful person she is and the important 10 year milestones she has crossed. She similarly surprised me a week ago with a surprise retirement dinner--an ouroboros of surprises. Like "The Gift of the Magi"
by O. Henry. 

Life is so Rich!!!


31 March

I began yesterday with "Expect surprises!" because I like the implied conflict of expecting the unexpected. 

Tomorrow is what many consider April Fools Day but, taking off on the surprise theme, I'd like to advise everyone to expect enchantments--positive surprises!

30 March


"Expect surprises!"  an optimistic oxymoronicum.


BREAKING somewhat interesting national news bits from this pm:

1.) Donny Trump indicted in NY.

2.) The main GOOPette found not guilty for skiing accident in Utah.


...continuing clangingly on the last two onomatapoeiae of kiss and suck:

Lips and anus as extrusions/extensions/extremes of the alimentary canal in humans. Do other animals have or do only humans have protruded lips?  like the anus, the lips are the ends of the alimentary canal which pucker externally.   Animals greet with their noses and tongues but dont 'kiss'.  ...and human kissing is generally an intimate activity.

Many years ago (probably 50, give or take), I drew a self-portrait with puckered lips, remarking the similarity to the anus (maybe it's just me?).  I'll see if i can find that drawing and enter it in a later posting.

A further irony/paradox is that animals (including humans) are tubes within tubes—really ‘outside in’ via the alimentary canal… lips connect anus with a tract (GI) which takes in food and water, extracts what the body needs, excreting the rest/waste.  Food from the outside stays outside the body (in the GI tract as it passes through the body). What passes through the GI tract never ‘enters’ the body. 

Burps, borborygmi and flati are manifestations of the gaseous passengers of the GI tract.

Farts (flati,flatulence) are the funniest though potentially most disconcerting of the three.  Butt they certainly are funny and the stuff of (mostly lowbrow) literature.  Salvador Dali wrote an essay on maiden or virgin farts.  An uncontrolled irregular semi-survey by me suggests that men fart more and louder than do women.  Men BRAAPPP, women 'pert' or 'pweet,' sometimes without even realizing it.

Farts are funny

Farts are fun

Percolating softly 

or rumbling on

  [by me, DV]


“Because of a very long fart, really a very long and, let us be frank, melodious fart, that I produced when I woke up, I was reminded of Michel de Montaigne. This author reports that Saint Augustine was a famous farter who succeeded in playing entire scores.”

Excerpt from Diary of a Genius by Salvador Dali

"Jar of Farts" From Dali's illustration based on the novel; "The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Renowned Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes” by François Rabelais.

...and James Joyce wrote privately to Nora about her gas:
“You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.”

Torque is energy in a twisting motion, which is measured in pound-feet. In another 'n of 1' uncontrolled approximation, I estimate that when farts are torqued into solids (gas is turned into poo-poo, aka shite), the solid excrement also has a pound-foot measure but in this case one shit-foot weighs about one pound avoirdupoisd.  Isn't science amazing?!!!


29 March

streaming with https://www.twitch.tv/vargolads this evening (and most Wednesday evenings) at 6 PM.

More of 'the similar other act' of JJ's APOTA (James Joyce's A Portrait Of The Artist).  The other end/act compared to Kiss of yesterday being "Suck".

  "Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.

  To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing."

...and, clanging on 'suck,' the following quote on Suck sess:

Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Robert Collier


28 March

A day without James Joyce, who ’turned his mind to unknown arts,’ is a day without insightful creative thought. 

F'r'instance, Deshil Commodius Eamus which could, i suppose mean 'The Shield of Commonwealth Amuses.'

Our Commonwealth house (Castillo Vargo) is a very very very fine house with…two cats...
…a bonded feral Siamese rescue pair  [But, as has been previously opined and even bumper stuck, who rescued whom?]

Being a James Joyce fan, I was planning to call them James and Joyce

Being a happily married James Joyce fan, WE call them Leopold and Livia (Leo and Livie).

I am going to call my next pet “Peeves” so I can introduce my friends to ‘my pet peeves.’  Peeves will probably be a turtle, or a unwanted mouse…Slow, dirty, irritating, maybe even infectious (salmonella, rickettsia, ohmygodosis...you name it).  Of course, cats can be fairly peevishly self-possessed and stand-off-ish, too.  Some might consider than part of their allure.

Some of my favourite early Joyce (and first onomatopoeia of 'kiss'), is from A Portrait: "What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?"

Monday, March 27

There is a best (at least in an Anselmian sense). My goal…the beginning of my morning ‘praymeditation’ is to ‘be better for the best!’

Mom101: Today would have been my mother’s 101st birthday.  Happy birthday, Alycce!

The pandemic ended up being an ~ 3 year transition into retirement for me. The whole of 2023 will be, in many ways, the transition into retirement. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have (and could have) retired much earlier. But, working from home, it was convenient to work, AND my wonderful wife made sure I was fed, watered and following safe Covid practices. Overall, especially the last almost 2 years, although I would have preferred no pandemic and although the precautions and isolation were not insignificantly inconvenient, the pandemic period had upsides—regular (and enhanced) reading and swimming, f’r’instance.
It is interesting how some friendships seem to have paused during the pandemic and some have frayed. 

Philosophically and absolutely I non-despondently ponder if there is even the possibility of nothing?


You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Innominal Patriotism is Filling and Spiritually Sanctifying

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live


‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.’”​ — Anthony de Mello​

Friday 24, 2023
My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

a lot of special friends and special memories.

Now, I’m thinking 'bout eternity
Some kind of ecstasy’s
Got a hold on me...
