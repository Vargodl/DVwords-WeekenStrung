PLEASE NOTE: All of these entries which aren't prior art are copyrighted © by me, Dennis Vargo, 2023.  I intend to not reveal specific embarassing intimacies of anyone so some of this will be generalized, anonymized and/oraltered for effect.

Aprill 11--Note that as of 11 AM today, I altered yesterdays entry a bit as well.

From nothing to nothing and the nothingness in between...

I don’t believe in the impossible

O Fortune, you are fickle as the moon, always waxing and waning;
this miserable life first wrecks, then cures at a whim; 
poverty and power melt like ice. 
Fate, you monster of emptiness, you malevolent whirling wheel- 
happiness is in vain, and always fades away.
   Orff’s Carmina



Sex!

i estimate that i have probably had about 20 sexual partners (involving AT LEAST but usually more than mutual nakedness, frottage or some orgiastic experience, usually shared (sequentially but sometimes simultaneously) by both).  Most but not of this was serial monogamy, sometimes serial agony.  Concerning night stands and hat stands, one night stands were very rare...though they occurred, usually with someone I otherwise knew before...and afterwards (though sometimes getting grief afterwards).  My youngest partner was
probably 15 when we began our intermittent dalliance.  The oldest was twice my age (le'ts just say she was older than 50).  That didnt end well primarily because after a few times together, I replaced her with a much younger (age congruent) partner.  Though she was a very liberal and educated older woman, I was surprised at how inexperienced she was...even shocked when i added a very slight hint of spice to our vanilla though we were still quite mainstream. It surprises me to realize it is very likely she has died of old age by now (or maybe the rapture of ecstacy?).  

Few of the women were virgins (how archaic is that concept?)...and in each case, I did not 'deflower them' (again, sorry for the medieval botanical reference).  The only non-white (in this case black) woman was a virgin who really seemed to wanted to go all the way but i felt too responible to so casually do that.  But, had I, we likely would have ended up in a longer term relationship--which could have been very nice; I think we were novelties for each other.  (And I realize from chatting with others and from movies that some girls really just 'want to get it over!')  Most though not all were North Americans.  There were several jews, mostly christians and/or spiritual at least.  I am unaware if any were muslim, Wiccan (though some ended up being real witches), or other Eastern religions.  Other than marriage, the longest, which was intermittent, probably lasted 8 years end to end with actual total time as a couple being 3.25 years.  There are at least 3 women (not included in the estimated 20), probably a lot more, that I regret not successfully pursuing more aggressively.  As is known, though, I was  was raised conservatively Catholic which means that I was required to confuse love with lust and have to convince myself I was in love before I could have sex.  The first time I was manually pleased, I literally shook all night because of my Catholic guilt.  The kind and gentle deliverer of such confusing ecstacy was afraid she had seriously hurt me in some inexplicable way.


My first boner fide sexual experiences were with a manatee.
My first girlfriend was a chubby spongy walrusy (though not ‘mousy’ except for certain ‘dies di mens’) girl on the girls swim team. It was our high school girls team so not everyone was in peak shape and form (and it took me years to appreciate the efforts of these cornfed fatbergs. As Paul Simon sang in Capeman, “like a ton of corned beef floating in beer.”)  My friends called her ‘manatee’ (sea cow) because of her rotund aquaphilia. She’d had her nose fixed after smashing on the side of the pool in a flip turn (which, sadly likely cost her the only school pool record she was ever going to get—such the cost of too much effort).  As a consequence of the nose mash, her sense of smell wasn’t good—although, unless she smelled like the chlorine in the pool, she usually smelled great (probably a bit overdone because she ‘overtitrated’ due to the nose thing). That being said, she almost always tasted great BUT there was something especially wonderful about the salty taste of her labia after swim practice. We were quite into 69, I think primarily because she was preserving her virginity for an unknown trigger later (which ended up…to my great dismay being xxx right around the time we were ending because she was mad at me and wanted to punish me [which worked very well let me tell you]).  Anyway, I thought she was comfortable gobbling on my stinky schmegmatoous flagrant rampant (to use, I think Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint) throbbing cock, spewing its foul hot mushroom milk because, due to her nose job, she couldn’t taste. Interesting afterwards, to sometimes smell YOUR COCK on your bedmate's breath.  Seems though since then, I’ve learned that she…and a fair percentage of woman…ACTUALLY DO LIKE TO SUCK COCK.  There is never the ceasing of wonder!

Most heterosexual want to have their cocks sucked…most gays and women apparently yet inexplicably like to succock.  And I have never been with a pussy that I didnt' find pretty, tasty, erotic and pleasing.

I kept experimenting with flavored and aroma’d (flavored) crotch shampoos/soaps/colognes (cockolones) to see if there was anything that would get a special “that tastes great” reaction to no avail.  I even experimented with flavored food to see if they had an effect though I never found one. I guess it isn’t the taste but the experience.

But then I realized that few really like or focus on the taste. It’s the Lusty erotic desire and/or driven obsession to be there and to share that is the be all end (all). Few are really in it for the taste. The lust center and obsession so overdrives the gustatory center.

Italian women’s netherlips  are slightly gar licky; French women’s clams are oysters in garlic.  Most Jewish women appreciate if you 'challah' down the canyon.  I especially like the taste of freshly washed and dried labia... perhaps with a little chianti!


…To quote Samuel Beckett: "Thats how it is on this bitch of an earth"


and, per Bruce Springsteen, With Every Wish:

These days I sit around and laugh
At the many rivers I've crossed
But on the far banks there's always another forest
Where a man can get lost
Well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides
Guiding us 'cross to another river on the other side
And there someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes
And though my heart's grown weary
And more than a little bit shy
Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst
And leave the angels to worry
With every wish (there comes a curse)

April 10

My love language is humor and surprise


PhD, GHD’s brother died Easter yesterday In Catania. RIP

So did Logan Roy…and so many people seem to care though in Logan’s case…really???  Get a life.

We often conflate excuse and explanation for cause. Any reasonable, rationale person frequently does this in the ongoing learn (and ideally learn and confirm) iterative process. Very rational, very Humean.  This can be very difficult is times of seismic (even if slow, with jiggly bits) shift.

That is where I am teetering with respect to the active male support of women’s rights, which I call “malefemnism” because I do think men will likely never completely understand what it means for women to be equal. That’s why I call it Malefemnism — because it is a male (and imperfect, ergo the mal—> bad) femnism (incomplete feminism).  I propose that most people agree that men are practically the dominant sex...And, it is unlikely men will ever be so omniscient that they will ever cede to complete parity...that is a bridge just a bit too far.

I consider myself an active supporter and attempted to understand this equality but I admit it is imperfect and in some ways uncomfortable because I’m still a bit insecure in it. Although I came of awareness in the second wave of femnism, I get confused with the “pronoun” titles miss, mrs, Ms. (Of course there’ they/them, etc., but that largely a different though similar story entirely.)

I was very close to my mom growing up and saw her working ALL THE TIME (seemingly) whereas I knew my dad worked hard at his job (and I saw many of the scars and burns he received at work).  But then he came home, did a few jobs as necessary but could relax where my mom never seemed to stop.  That seeming inequity is my early entry into feminism.

Puberty and the Catholic Church kind of messed some of that up for me.  There is something about the female body (this is instinctive, reactive, semi-automatic, I think)—especially the naked body or the braless, nipples blaring tight top (and  many of the other revealing 'coverings' what seem to me to be uncomfortable yet so provocative they push the perve autopilot button) that makes men (at least me) mindless. Love lust sex pleasure procreation, mostly admittedly selfish pleasure—some combination of that and others and feminism is very difficult to rationally support at those times…even as a malefemnist.  Some other “animal brain” which rapidly cycles fast and slow takes over—it’s like the little devil on your left shoulder knocking out the little angel on your right shoulder with sleeping gas.

How/why did this inequity ever come about?  There are no causes but I think I have some postulative explanations, including though not necessarily in any definitive order:

x Women are physically smaller and weaker…better to be subservient than always at unknown risks;

x The obvious physical changes that occur at puberty…triggering male urges and brainlessness  mentioned above

x The male sexual equipment, protruding, penetrative (and relatively quick to erect and be satisfied) vs the inner hidden receptacle of the female…historically a secondary consideration for pleasure (if a consideration).  The external dangling male member is also, because it dangles and jiggles, somewhat self stimulating, making it easy to be further aroused by the female. Once the male has been satisfied, there may not have been the reciprocation of pleasure, perhaps not even the knowledge or desire for it.  (It takes a long time for the male to control himself for mutual pleasure—especially when the ‘heat oft5he moment’ gets uncontrollably hot. (In fact, I sometimes wonder if orgasm is actually pleasurable (I really think it very much is) or merely so programmed, instinctive and automatic that the experiencer isn’t really aware (during as well as anytime after) but goes through a series of mind-altering neurobiological, neurochemical, neurohormonal, neuropheromonal and other mind altering, mind numbing alterations and gyrations which in themselves imbue the experience with a recollection of intense pleasure and the reinforcing mindless urgency to do it over and over…perhaps similar if not identical to rats, cocaine and dopamine? One has to wonder if dpoamine was so named because it turns post-orgasmic man into a dopey character.

x The ability/risk of getting pregnant and pregnancy itself--which can elicit protectiveness and vulnerability--not to mention the miraculous element of the process

x Childbirth, including (historically) high maternal and infant mortality

x Lactation with its seemingly natural purpose and benefits but which keep mothers down (also enhancing the female frontal contour)

x The likely frequent feminine social and emotional abilities to keep peace vs the male “catch and kill” competition.  Even now, boys play at war with Toy soldiers (winners and losers), whereas girls play with their Barbies socializing at tea.  [I know that some of this may be contemporary societal programming.]
(I think it was Margaret Atwood who wrote: no matter how high the tech, Homo sapiens remains at heart what he's been for tens of thousands of years -the same emotions, the same preoccupations, the same good, bad, and ugly. Were a mixed bag, we humans.
The genetic familiarity in offspring which keep fathers invested…and protective.
etc…

I do believe that, in general, progress is being made though it is staccato, backsliding intermittently and, with the repeal of Roe v Wade and the recent judgement by a Texas judge’s ruling on the abortion medication mifepristone.  Having worked in the pharma industry for most of my career, this seems like significant and worrisome judicial overreach which can happen when there is maliscious intent.  The FDA approves drugs, including the approved indications. The judiciary doesn’t have anything to do with this, which is a rigorous scientific review process.  It seems similar to if a Texas judge decided that Jeff Bezos foundation loses its tax benefits (leaving other foundations unaffected).
It’s like boiling a frog…losing rights slowly, so slowly that you don’t recognize it until it is too late. 

...And its worrisome.

"Sinned by Dev'lish"© Dennis Vargo, 2023.


The following topics to be elaborated on over the next few days: Malefemnism, con/tra/ception, the lowerarchy and Catholicism in context

More on mom: 
1. although they weren't called such at the time, mom's "love languages" were service, deprivation and sacrifice
2. her main nutrition group was caffeinated beverages: hot lipton (or cheaper) teabag tea in the morning and one  16 oz bottle of pop at a time  which she had us buy from from Wiltz, local store, to which we would walk for her, usually alone.

THE ORIGIN OF LAUGHTER by John Updike
(after Desmond Morris)

Hunched in the dark beneath his mother's heart, 
The fetus sleeps and listens; dropped into light, 
He seeks to lean his ear against the breast 
Where the known rhythm holds its secret pace.



Slowly, slowly, through blizzards of dozing, 
A face is gathered, starting with the eyes--
At first, quite any face; two painted dots 
On cardboard stir a responsive smile. Soon 
No face but one will serve: the mother's, 
A mist, a cloud that clearly understands.



She teases him, pretends to let him drop.
He wants to cry but knows that she is good.
Out of this sudden mix, this terror rimmed 
With necessary flesh, a laugh is born.





April 7

Although my mom was upper or mid lower class, she grew up in a place, space, culture and time when men beat their wives who then joined them in beating their kids propagating a viscous (in both senses of the term) cycle. (This did not happen to her and us but it happened all around us and no-one did anything about it.). This was a time when priests preyed on parochial students (which I know from personal experience).
There was definitely a double standard—a situation I am afraid we may be returning to with a razor thin political divide that even though it is about equally women, the women on each side seem to think (or don’t think) differently—especially when it comes to women’s rights. (As I write this, a Texas federal judge is halting the FDA approval of abortion pill mifepristone and Roe v Wade was recently overturned).  Her father “allowed” her to go to high school even though his mates mocked him for wasting education on a girl. So her way out, was to get married (and work). 
  She did get married and had 4 kids: 2 older girls and then 2 boys, me being the older son. My mom remarked at how attentive my dad was to her while she was in the hospital with the girls but when I was borne he wasn’t. Rather, he was out calling all family and friends to brag “I have a son!” My dads name was Frank and I was supposed to take that name as a family tradition for the first born male. Instead she named me something different. 

My mom was dutiful but not happy and I think she got increasingly depressed as she felt trapped in her increasingly constricted situation.   I know that she didn’t enjoy sex (at least that’s what my sister told me. I also know that I wasn’t breast fed, resulting in my brother being born 13 months after me. She slowly stopped taking care of herself, smoking more and drinking (beer) regularly and alone, reminiscent of Picasso’s The Absinthe Drinker.  She cooked for us and was very clean, pinning her hair with Bobby pins every night before work. But she barely ate the food she cooked and seemed to subsist mostly on Pepsi (or Coke), tea with real lemon juice. She also became increasingly isolated, not wanting to see others or even talk on the phone. She went to church religiously (as required) but always stayed in the back of the church. She was a compliant but nominal catholic. 

She didn’t want to socialize or travel but rather stayed at home drinking and smoking later and later into the night.  My dad supplied her booze and ciggies but increasingly stopped being with her during these periods. She became increasingly unhealthy. 

She worked until she had her first small stroke. My dad had retired earlier and he was looking forward to their traveling but that never really happened because of her stroke. She had a nearly fatal stroke while I was out of contact, moving to Chicago from Indianapolis. She spent several months in the hospital and then several years wheelchair bounds, right-side paralyzed and unable to speak. She should have faded away at home but my dad freaked out when she became comatose. I took her to the ER where she was hospitalized, dying of urosepsis a few hours later. She died about 10 months after Alex was borne. Winston never met her. 

I wish life had been much better and more fair to her. I loved her and she deserved so much more. She wanted to be a nurse or a teacher…I’m not sure she wanted to be a parent. I am mostly sad when I think about her life. 


April 6

You can't go home again, said Thomas Wolfe--but you can retrieve the past by writing about it. (Margaret Atwood)

Yesterday I wrote mostly about my dad. Today I will mostly explore my more complex and complicated relationship with my mother

To be at least a good mother must be the hardest of the very common jobs with the largest membership.  On top of everything else every other class of person does, a mother has to use her uterus, vagina and brain not just for pleasure but also for nurturing, maintaining and propagating the species while being inconvenienced, sleep-deprived and semi-(at least)-incapacitated for a duration much beyond the gestational and lactational through to educational, recreational, differentiational,  separational and much beyond.  The job never really ends although it frequently does transmute into a positive bidirectional symbiosis.

And the sons in their lives become especially attentive to and protective of the mother.  I for example once literally left my cousin on the side of the road in Rhode Island when he accused my mother of cheating at cards (canasta) but would not support the accusation with any examples. I mean, c’mon…canasta?

(I guess when it comes to “fightin’ words,” moms can easily defend themselves probably better than we can but “fightin’ words” are really trigger words to provoke confrontation…and I responded.)

As Margaret Atwood also wrote, the pen is mightier than the sword, but only in retrospect: at the time of combat, those with the swords generally win.…and, I add, when push comes to shove, men will do most of the shoving and women will be the ones most pushed around. 


The bond between a mother and her child is even more individualized and unique than is the bond between a mother and her children. i always thought that I was my mom's favorite but so did each of my sibs.

My mom could, and did, ease my cares and fears even if she had to lie (not that anyone would consider her to be a liar, because she wasn’t).  One night when I was about 9 years old, I was night terrorized by the overwhelming knowledge that I was going to die that night.  I came crying uncontrollably to her and she simply said that everything was going to be okay.  I was able to sleep that night and all the nights afterward.  After knee surgery, between confused spasms of returning consciousness, somehow I knew she was there with me, poking me in the back and saying, “mom’s here, mom’s here!”

Overall she was the axis around which my young self revolved into maturity in its comfortable orbit.  As I got older, I started to realize she was an independent person with thoughts, dreams, likes, a history and a societally imposed composition of roles, foibles, demons (image in au pair book shelf) and habits (both positive and self-destructive)…and I wondered why there seemed to differences in the way men and women were treated and the different expectations imposed upon them.  Whereas my dad left home to work all day every weekday, she worked away at various jobs but also seemed to be always working at home as well—cooking, washing, cleaning and so forth.

…to be continued tomorrow,



April 5

In praise of a father.

My dad was a fairly simple though very curious, mostly self-taught guy who loved life, his four kids and naively believed in the power of education. He was also devoted and dedicated to his wife (my mom) taking care of her in his clumsy clunky way after her severe debilitating stroke which, because it’s resulting depression and paranoia, caused her to be angry and mean to him and to openly call the neighbor a bitch for having an affair with him—neither of which were true. In her post stroke angry paranoid confused state, she was physically abusive to him, too, kicking and slapping him. To be fair in very small part he encouraged her to try to hit him with her withered, stroke-shrunken right arm—his best awkward attempts to get her some physical therapy.

Both of my parents were of lower middle class Eastern European, Catholic descent.  My mom's parents were born in Poland and my mom grew up in an American Polish 'ghetto' with Polish being her first and only language (until she went to school at the local parochial grade school {which I also attended}.  My dad's mom was born in America of Polish immigrants and his father was from Hungary.  This was an issue when my dad met my mom's father (dziadzia in Polish) in that my dziadzia was unwilling to meet my dad at first because of his last name (which was Hungarian).  Dziadzia supposedly said that if my dad was not polish, he may as well be a Jew. (I include this only as a reference to my background as mentioned yesterday.)   

Ironically, our last name really isn't hungarian but is probabaly not our real name but an Ellis Island artifact. The was a very unsettling realization when I learned (about 20 years ago) that my identity (at least the identity I associated with the heritage of my last name) was false.

My dad's early circumstances weren’t easy. Being of mixed parents (Polish AND Hungarian), they spoke english in his house and he failed second grade because he couldn’t speak Polish (the laanguage of his parochial school) so he couldn’t really learn or succeed in school. His father died due to an industrial accident at the Studebaker factory which probably ruptured his liver and/or spleen, telling my dad with his dying words that he ‘was now the man of the family,’ and to take care of his mom and his multiple younger siblings.  My dad was 13 at the time so he dropped out of high school to support his mom and his sibs.

He was a gently guy with dreams and desires and the drive for continual self-improvement.  He worked his way up and out including stoking his wanderlust by leaving landlocked northern Indiana and joining the WWII US Navy.  And...he read a lot.

After the navy, he met my mom as they were on separate bowling leagues.  She was attracted to him even though he was kind of from the 'other side of the tracks.'  Although my mom's family was by no means wealthy, my dziadzia was a grocer so they always had food, cigarettes (my mom's vice which contributed to her illnesses) and a car.  My mom always said she had better off suitors but she somehow fell in love with "poor Fxxxx Vzzzz" a comment that always hurt my feelings when she told me.

After leaving the navy and being a married father, although he never graduated from high school, he got his GED and took home study courses in auto mechanics. He took swimming lessons when I was in kindergarten.  I remember going to the natatorium with the younger of my two sisters and our younger brother while he learned to swim.  Although he never went to college, he expected all of his children to get higher degrees because we were 'college material' (as our teachers told him, which made him beam with pride).  He had a continual desire for improvement and betterment and was optimistic to the core.

Because his circumstances were meager, he always worried about money.  I unfortunately picked that up from him too.  Ironically, perhaps, he had a lust and zest for life and didn't want it to end.  He developed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia in his 80's and minimized how it intruded in his life.  He wanted to get a bone marrow transplant in the hopes of being cured but he was too old at the time to justify the risk (according to the doctors---he was willing if it gave him a chance for a cure).

There are many things I picked up from my dad and I cherish:  My own wonderlust, my desire to continue to learn and improve, my getting a college degreee and an MD, my love of swimming and, especially, the love of my sons.  Like in many families, I am sure, my dad was the softie and my mom was the disciplinarian.  I am very grateful to him for all of that.

I also remember when my dad would play with my sons when they were young.  He would get on the floor and play with them in a fun, funny non-pretentious way that reminded me of what a wonderful, acceptable and forgiving father he was to me.

Being an american male from the WW era, he didn't tell us he loved us very much...but we knew he did.

I wish he were stil here because I would value his way of being, his kindness and gentleness and his positivity.


April 4

I had no real experience with Jews growing up except the inappropriate and wrong view of them as alien, untrustworthy, shrewd.  

“Jew” was a noun, adjective and verb. That being said, I was never brought up to think of Jews as Christ Killers.

I have certainly matured in this respect at least.  I went to Brandeis University, Almost married a Jewish Brandeisienne and have many very close Jewish friends.  

In addition, as I have moved to various places, I have probably belonged to 4-5 Jewish Community Centers, primarily to swim in their pools.  This includes my current membership at the JCC of greater Boston (Newton), where I probably swim 6 times a week.  We do wear swim caps like in Woody Allen movies.  Of interest, my current JCC has a lot of really old, crumpled, hunched members so, even though I recently retired, I still feel young in that crowd.  

Tomorrow begins Passover which means the JCC is closed for the next 1 1/2 days for the eight-day Jewish holiday which commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.  In Hebrew Passover is known as Pesach (which means “to pass over”), because God passed over the Jewish homes, saving the Jews, when killing the Egyptian firstborn on the very first Passover eve.

Sadly, in the last year and a half of membership, the JCC has had at least 2 bomb threats…which is unfortunate, frightening and representative of the increasing anti-semitism in most parts of the world, including the USA.

The New England Patriots owner Robert Frost via his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism—introduced the blue square emoji as a symbol of solidarity with the Jewish people as part of the #StandUpToJewishHate campaign.  I support and endorse this. (As an aside, Robert and his recently deceased first wife, Myrna, were great supporters of Brandeis causes.  He probably still is.)

#🟦,  #StandUpToJewishHate

April 3rd

I just started a new, separate thread holding the pictures from Margie's party, which you can goto if you select the "Vargodl" at the top left of this page.

Today was a further 'returning to our "new" reality--home with an increasing sense of technological home security.  Margie may have mentioned that we had 'bigfoot' apparently come to visit us (aka case the joint) a couple of weeks ago. courtesy of snowfall, we saw his yeti tracks and became concerned about security--we have many windows (although new, secure and casement) and doors which are protective, but wont keep out someone with the need to enter.

Over the past weeks since biggie oggled, we've significantly upgraded our security--now with motion detectors, lights, videocameras, sirens as well as central monitoring (re-initiated) and non-denomininational space lasers which remotely inject Bill Gates' most uptodate-but excruciatingly painful, GPS tracking chips into the buttocks (and, in fact, the bollocks, if they are present) of unwanted uninvited visitors.

Security is important especially as we occasionally leave our kitties over night though we have the capability to see them on the little remote screen now.

We are very fortunate to have some nice stuff and live in one of the safest places around Boston.  Nonetheless, "some nice stuff" sometimes attracts the riff and the raff.  But we don't want to be owned by our possessions.

2 April

Recently back from NYC and a quick but very pleasant and (if I might say so) very successful surprise weekend for Margie. I am so very grateful for all who came to the city to share. It was inconvenient for everyone but I think everyone had a great time and would do it again. I am so especially grateful to Winston for helping to make it happen. 

Margie and I love each other very much and made the new vow to "never not" love each other.

1 April--April Enchantment (instead of Fools) Day

A wonderful surprise for my fantastic wife. 

Dinner with dear friends Pauline, Louie, Kevin, Abdu, Joanne, Jess, Rich, Stephanie, Stuart as well as Win (who was instrumental in planning and arranging) at Emilio's Balotto in NYC. 

As Scott Galloway says, Life is so rich!

And...as has been increasingly stated, close friends are very important to health and longevity. 

We are blessed with wonderful friends. 

...And, I dearly love my wife. I surprised her today for the wonderful person she is and the important 10 year milestones she has crossed. She similarly surprised me a week ago with a surprise retirement dinner--an ouroboros of surprises. Like "The Gift of the Magi"
by O. Henry. 

Life is so Rich!!!


31 March

I began yesterday with "Expect surprises!" because I like the implied conflict of expecting the unexpected. 

Tomorrow is what many consider April Fools Day but, taking off on the surprise theme, I'd like to advise everyone to expect enchantments--positive surprises!

30 March


"Expect surprises!"  an optimistic oxymoronicum.


BREAKING somewhat interesting national news bits from this pm:

1.) Donny Trump indicted in NY.

2.) The main GOOPette found not guilty for skiing accident in Utah.


...continuing clangingly on the last two onomatapoeiae of kiss and suck:

Lips and anus as extrusions/extensions/extremes of the alimentary canal in humans. Do other animals have or do only humans have protruded lips?  like the anus, the lips are the ends of the alimentary canal which pucker externally.   Animals greet with their noses and tongues but dont 'kiss'.  ...and human kissing is generally an intimate activity.

Many years ago (probably 50, give or take), I drew a self-portrait with puckered lips, remarking the similarity to the anus (maybe it's just me?).  I'll see if i can find that drawing and enter it in a later posting.

A further irony/paradox is that animals (including humans) are tubes within tubes—really ‘outside in’ via the alimentary canal… lips connect anus with a tract (GI) which takes in food and water, extracts what the body needs, excreting the rest/waste.  Food from the outside stays outside the body (in the GI tract as it passes through the body). What passes through the GI tract never ‘enters’ the body. 

Burps, borborygmi and flati are manifestations of the gaseous passengers of the GI tract.

Farts (flati,flatulence) are the funniest though potentially most disconcerting of the three.  Butt they certainly are funny and the stuff of (mostly lowbrow) literature.  Salvador Dali wrote an essay on maiden or virgin farts.  An uncontrolled irregular semi-survey by me suggests that men fart more and louder than do women.  Men BRAAPPP, women 'pert' or 'pweet,' sometimes without even realizing it.

Farts are funny

Farts are fun

Percolating softly 

or rumbling on

  [by me, DV]


“Because of a very long fart, really a very long and, let us be frank, melodious fart, that I produced when I woke up, I was reminded of Michel de Montaigne. This author reports that Saint Augustine was a famous farter who succeeded in playing entire scores.”

Excerpt from Diary of a Genius by Salvador Dali

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128755897/228987964-1229e64a-0f7f-49c1-84d3-3ff44279484f.jpeg)

"Jar of Farts" From Dali's illustration based on the novel; "The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Renowned Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes” by François Rabelais.

...and James Joyce wrote privately to Nora about her gas:
“You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.”

Torque is energy in a twisting motion, which is measured in pound-feet. In another 'n of 1' uncontrolled approximation, I estimate that when farts are torqued into solids (gas is turned into poo-poo, aka shite), the solid excrement also has a pound-foot measure but in this case one shit-foot weighs about one pound avoirdupoisd.  Isn't science amazing?!!!

streaming with https://www.twitch.tv/vargolads this evening (and most Wednesday evenings) at 6 PM.

More of 'the similar other act' of JJ's APOTA (James Joyce's A Portrait Of The Artist).  The other end/act compared to Kiss of yesterday being "Suck".

  "Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.

  To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing."

...and, clanging on 'suck,' the following quote on Suck sess:

Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Robert Collier


28 March

A day without James Joyce, who ’turned his mind to unknown arts,’ is a day without insightful creative thought. 

F'r'instance, Deshil Commodius Eamus which could, i suppose mean 'The Shield of Commonwealth Amuses.'

Our Commonwealth house (Castillo Vargo) is a very very very fine house with…two cats...
…a bonded feral Siamese rescue pair  [But, as has been previously opined and even bumper stuck, who rescued whom?]

Being a James Joyce fan, I was planning to call them James and Joyce

Being a happily married James Joyce fan, WE call them Leopold and Livia (Leo and Livie).

I am going to call my next pet “Peeves” so I can introduce my friends to ‘my pet peeves.’  Peeves will probably be a turtle, or a unwanted mouse…Slow, dirty, irritating, maybe even infectious (salmonella, rickettsia, ohmygodosis...you name it).  Of course, cats can be fairly peevishly self-possessed and stand-off-ish, too.  Some might consider than part of their allure.

Some of my favourite early Joyce (and first onomatopoeia of 'kiss'), is from A Portrait: "What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?"

There is a best (at least in an Anselmian sense). My goal…the beginning of my morning ‘praymeditation’ is to ‘be better for the best!’

Mom101: Today would have been my mother’s 101st birthday.  Happy birthday, Alycce!

The pandemic ended up being an ~ 3 year transition into retirement for me. The whole of 2023 will be, in many ways, the transition into retirement. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have (and could have) retired much earlier. But, working from home, it was convenient to work, AND my wonderful wife made sure I was fed, watered and following safe Covid practices. Overall, especially the last almost 2 years, although I would have preferred no pandemic and although the precautions and isolation were not insignificantly inconvenient, the pandemic period had upsides—regular (and enhanced) reading and swimming, f’r’instance.
It is interesting how some friendships seem to have paused during the pandemic and some have frayed. 

Philosophically and absolutely I non-despondently ponder if there is even the possibility of nothing?


You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Innominal Patriotism is Filling and Spiritually Sanctifying

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live

My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

Now, I’m thinking 'bout eternity

Got a hold on me...
