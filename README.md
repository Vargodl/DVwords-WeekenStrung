Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live

Friday 24, 2023
My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

a lot of special friends and special memories.

Now, I’m thinking 'bout eternity
Some kind of ecstasy’s
Got a hold on me...
