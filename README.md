This has been an even much better day than expected.

After 10 years, Margie was 'fired' by her oncological surgeon with s 'call us if you need us!'

This is great news as she is 10 years past her 'double fuckerotomy' for early stage breast cancer in her left boob.  She took tamoxifen for 5 years--some, not all, oncologists saying that was overkill.

  Now she is done with all scheduled cancer followup...and we celebrated.

I started the day with the pleasant reminiscence of a "Neep, Neep!" see attached:

A Neep, Neep is an anyhropomorphized banana that I used to draw for the boys when they were young that we would have little puppet-like stories briefly with.  I dont teally know but I think they made the 'Neep, Neep' sound and in a linguistic transition (synechdote?) they took on the name.  
Such a fine memory...

It’s been 70 years between coronations in
the dwindling luxury brand of the British empire —probably most effective for monetizing merchandise and people.  Although I thought Brexit was the wrong, Putin-influenced decision, I hope this is the last coronation for a much smaller United (only/sort of) Kingdom because it seems a self-indulgent money, prestige and power grab by the ‘firm’ of a racist family that don’t actually have any power.   
The coronation of ‘the king’ yesterday cost (mostly the British taxpayers)  around 100 million pounds—and that was supposedly downsized. Half the population watched—the other half on the food lines. Other than the British populace there, most of the paying attendees seemed to have been visiting dignitaries, press (including people from Boston TV channels…and widely smiling Lionel Ritchie. 
Harry, in self-imposed exile, was there to represent the most obviously self-absorbed and self-promoting appendix of the royally confused family.

Word meanings…

I like, appreciate, laud and am awed by the power of words, soft words, power words, words slanting leftwards/rightwards, words cursive (Fuck) and shocking (rape). I’m not especially interested in offense (cunt) but rather surprise (zouch).
Words that ‘can’t be said’ (though I’m not exactly sure why they can’t (by some, not all at least)) no matter the context. 

Clearly it is not the word, not the series of letters, nay the sounds but rather the meaning and (even more than meaning), the connotation.  Even oblique references to the offensive word can be offensive (the best example I can think of is “See (C) you (U) Next Tuesday,” which I recently heard Stephen Colbert say when referring to Tucker Carlson’s ‘Troubles’).
This is one of the reasons that words can be either powerful, incomprehensible or bland in foreign languages… and why we try to learn the dirty words in the languages we are studying. 

For words to be offensive, of course, there has to be someone(s) who are offended…increasingly powerful by how many someones are in the group and how 'important/influential' they are, how legitimately aggrieved it is, how unified, how aware the offenders are and especially if they are indifferent or even hostile to the group, how vocal and how long they’ve been aggrieved (among other criteria).

Words are beautiful. Like David Hume’s statement about beauty:  “Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.”
In this case “offensiveness/danger’ is no quality in words themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different offensiveness.”

So it is important to appreciate the meaning and power of words but not be cowed by them. To know how to use words yet not run from them. 

Two pertinent Nietzsche quotes:

Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are. 

The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.

Words can be powerful, impactful, shocking even mean...but they aren't sticks and stones...they can't hurt you.  They can be loaded but they dont pierce flesh.  The biggest risks are emotional injury or perhaps incitement to violence.  But to let words incite violent behaviour is a choice or at least lack of control.

Jean Carrol, in her trial against D Trump, accuses him of raping her.  She does avoid that word, she maybe the victim but she is denying victimhood.


I've really enjoyed the following letter about words.  like the author, I modified it and used it as a cover letter and it indeed got me in the door:

“Dear Sir:
I like words. I like fat buttery words, such as ooze, turpitude, glutinous, toady. I like solemn, angular, creaky words, such as straitlaced, cantankerous, pecunious, valedictory. I like spurious, black-is-white words, such as mortician, liquidate, tonsorial, demi-monde. I like suave “V” words, such as Svengali, svelte, bravura, verve. I like crunchy, brittle, crackly words, such as splinter, grapple, jostle, crusty.
I like sullen, crabbed, scowling words, such as skulk, glower, scabby, churl. I like Oh-Heavens, my-gracious, land’s-sake words, such as tricksy, tucker, genteel, horrid. I like elegant, flowery words, such as estivate, peregrinate, elysium, halcyon. I like wormy, squirmy, mealy words, such as crawl, blubber, squeal, drip. I like sniggly, chuckling words, such as cowlick, gurgle, bubble and burp.
I like the word screenwriter better than copywriter, so I decided to quit my job in a New York advertising agency and try my luck in Hollywood, but before taking the plunge I went to Europe for a year of study, contemplation and horsing around.
I have just returned and I still like words.
May I have a few with you?
Robert Pirosh”

Excerpt From Letters of Note: Volume 1 by Shaun Usher

...and one more thing:

A young man came to Mozart, and said, ‘I want to compose symphonies. I want to talk to you about that.’
Mozart said, ‘How old are you?’ ‘Twenty-two.’
And Mozart said, ‘You’re too young to do symphonies.’
And the guy says, ‘But you were writing symphonies when you were ten years old.’
Mozart answers, ‘Yes, but I wasn’t running around asking other people how to do it.’”

I don't generally regugitate VARGOLADZ here but today's was uniquely interesting as I was going to have my MVP (Most Valuable Player) about symbolism and meaning
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128755897/236116092-6bb78e34-da2f-4598-bf4a-499b20af5a43.jpeg)
but we really discussed semantics, especially the word RAPE.  The younger others affirmed that the R word shouldn't be used, but should rather be referred to as 'sexual assault.'  I never heard of such a ban and, from a transitive or logical perspective, I would suggest that they don't refer to identical things.  In other words, rape is a sexual assault but sexual assault isn't necesarrily rape.  Sexual assault is a much broader, basket term.  I agree the word 'rape' is a powerful, jarring term--and it should be because it is a horrific, violent act.
I checked with Margie, too, and she also didn't know that the word was cancelled.  So I'm not sure there is a concensus here...maybe more of a generational thing?

Though it shouldn't need to be stated or restated, I think sexual including rape are horrible violations.  I am confident that I never did and I never will commit or condone such acts.

The first time I performed cunnilingus was in a sleeping bag on the floor of a walk-up college apartment in Terre Haute Indiana—this was SOOOO exciting I had a spontaneous, involuntary back-arching, orgasm, clumsily (I am sure) and uneducatedly, clitorally unawaredly sloppily slurping in the literal lap of sweet lady’s ecstasy. I doubt she had the same experience. 

I thought we would ‘go all the way’ and asked to ‘make love’ to her to which she abruptly ‘broke my zipper’ with a deflating, definitive, very confusing NO!

Eventually, when the time (of the month) was right, we committed our first glorious brain emptying PVI (penile vaginal intromission)—and WHAT AN  e-MISSION IT WAS!!!. We lit an uncontrollable electric wildfire  putting a throbbing, plundering exposed coiled nerve into her warm moist silk purse and depositing my milk money there. We did this in the upper bunk bed of my bedroom while War’s The World Is A Ghetto* https://youtu.be/WFmCCxMp7BE was playing—a seemingly inappropriately titled song was actually rhythmically perfect for sex (slow zoom please). Our ‘Frank Sinatra’ was War!  The World Is A Ghetto obviously became our post-coital private message, our ‘wink! wink!’ song and secret mating call, which I also secretly messaged as last words of my philosophy high school thesis. (“Despite it all, life can be a most amazing experience even if the world is a ghetto.”)

Catholically confused about (eg against artificial) birth control—we ‘got rhythm,’ red wave riding, and interruptus…AND monthly pregnancy scares.  Me every time LITERALLY telling her “we’ll, I guess we have to get married then”, while internally telling myself what a fucking idiot I was, figuratively kicking myself in the head telling myself I must never do that again..but unable to stop myself and reliving the fear of destroying my life EVERY MONTH!  This was especially true one time in the summer when we had our first mutual spontaneous abortion…er, I mean, orgasm, in her back yard.  (Another life begun, mine done.)  I was so ignorant I really thought that the intensity of that mutual event signified a magically successful impregnating. That was stupid, but terrifying. Such the power of lusty youthful sexual urges and the dangers of ignorance. 


I now understand why some of the great literature, great wars and many idiotic mistakes have been made. How men are caught ‘in flagrante (and rampante) dicto’ by jealous husbands even though they hear the husband in the house/on the stairs/at the door because they are unable to not have that one last thrust. How ineffective coitus interruptus really is but at the moment the brain ceases to function. Like the reputed (though disproven) dinosaur, it is the lower pelvic brain that thinks it is thinking when in fact only a reflex procreative loop of the 'errant rampant penis' has been engaged.  Not only have thousands of ships been launched, my submarine itself has fired thousands of torpedoes and billions of tiny homuncular swimmer frogmen have died!

Being a ’good’ Catholic girl (who not only couldn’t control her lusts but did not lead me not into temptation but rather led me forth THROUGH her wonderful, silky, wet, receptive and quivering pillars of temptation), she did not believe or support abortion. In fact she was on the debate team to argue against it. Strangely a year or two after we broke up, she wrote me from college and asked me if I would send her $500 so that she COULD have an abortion (not my child).

This song by Chad & Jeremy, is in honor of those clumsy efforts:

It wasn’t until the 21st  century that I began to experience the pubic sculpting, lasering, razoring, braziering, runways, skid marks, goatees up to and including the cantatrice chauve of the modern woman’s eschutcheon…and I’m up for it all. Beavers, toes of camels, the other thing that smells like fish, meat flaps, snatches, coinslots, gossamer Hymenoptera…you name it. I can’t get enough. 


*most interestingly, in researching this, I have discovered that for all these years, remembered the correct album but the wrong ‘Frank Sinatra’ song of our first PVI. The album was The World is a Ghetto (it was my album and I remember the cover vividly) but the song (and the link) was Four-Cornered Room.  Marcel Proust, even though the madeleine was just as sweet, where’ve you been all these years?

The Opportune Gift of Friendship

‘Life’ is a banquet, fecund, perhaps even fractal, in its many opportunities and riches.  Some of the greatest riches are the natural inclinations for connecting, bonding and collaborating which occur between most living beings—inter and intra-species.  These are filigreed in us humans in our reciprocal interactions and relationship with pals and partners…friends and lovers, and we as individuals.

Our friends shine spotlights on the many opportunities life offers so that we can better see, share, enjoy and appreciate them.  These relationships are chapters of our personal life books that stretch and expand us beyond our innate individual limitation in space, thought and time and outside of ourselves—expanding our intellects, our reaches and our limited spans. We travel further when we travel with our companions of books…and others.  

“Best friends” (really ‘better’ friends, because most of us are fortunate enough to have several in the course of our lives) are the real magic of connectedness. These are the friends with whom we can resume the relation despite years of disconnection or separation, kind of like a discussion interrupted by being separated into different elevator cars which resumes as soon as the elevator doors open, the riders reconnect and the conversation resumes, barely missing a phrase. In this analogy, the elevator, like the friendship,  lifts us up taking us higher to where we want to go.  (And sometimes, we just ride for the joy of being with a friend.)

Today a group of us shared a surprise brunch celebration for a friend’s (FV) next employment chapter as he starts a new job tomorrow.  We surprised him with our love and support in this worthwhile venture.  He knows we are there for him and share his excitement.

Similarly, I resumed an ‘elevator-interrupted’ conversation with a special friend (RN) this evening.

So, here’s to friends…the flowers in our gardens…our sparks of joy. 

Thank you for being a friend

April 28

An interesting day--have been on line most of the day with the Andrew Weill Center on Alternative Medicine, which has been very interesting so far.  Including with the interesting presenter with massive sunglasses due to the headaches of traumatic brain injury talking about medical creative poetry (without rules).  Interesting that her somewhat bizarre appearance does cause one (me) to 'wonder if she is all there.'  Sad, probably unfair, but true.  Similar to the topic of mental illness mentioned yesterday.  

I began my post-Med School training in Psychiatry at the University of Chicago (a very biological (medically oriented) approach.  It was even then a speciality looking for rigor.  The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) which was the basis of diagnosis was like  a chinese menu-->  if your patient has 3 of the 5 main symptoms from column A, 3 of the 7 from column B and is less than 65 years old...the diagnosis is xxx.  And even then, symptoms are prone to interpretation and therefore inexact.  Further the DSM kept amending, revising and changing.  I don't even thingk homosexuality is a disease any more...Imagine that???  Although the diagnostic tools do get better, it is still largely a matter of interpreting actions and words.  So it is not too much a stretch to imagine that psychiatry could be an instrument to control those who they who are in power want or need to control.  I'm not suggesting that this is and has been the only purpose or use for psychiatry...I don't believe it is.

As mentioned yesterday, psychiatry and asylums were used to control 'wayward,' independent wives and women.  (Some simply because they enjoyed masturbation too much (not sure how much that is) and some because ... believe it or not ... they did not want to have sex with their husbands.)  I suppose if divorce weren't so frowned upon at the time (including for women who often probably had no means of support after divorce), the institutionalization of women would have been less.

“When I was in the asylum they locked me up..but what did I care for that as long as they had no key that would fit my mouth?”
Phebe B Davis, 1855


I learned a few interesting bits today:
1)  The word  Eskimo has a racist history and most people in Canada and Greenland still prefer other terms. The most widespread is Inuit, which means simply, "people." The singular, which means "person," is Inuk.
2)  One of my favorite meals, pasta puttanesca, may have been named because puttanesca is the adjectival term for 'whore' or 'prostitute'  and it may have been invented in one of many bordellos in Naples working-class neighbourhoods as a quick meal taken between servicing clients. Alternatively, according to food historian Jeremy Parzen: "Italians use puttana (and related words) almost the way we use shit, as an all-purpose profanity, so pasta alla puttanesca might have originated with someone saying, essentially, 'I just threw a bunch of shit from the cupboard into a pan'.

Try as we might, men are probably at best myopic feminists, or myopic anti-chauvinists.  Many of us are sensitized to the equality of women but, like someone else's pain, you can try to be aware of it but it probably doesn't always intrude (painfully) into your very being.

I finished my Margie's LasSupprise tableau today (to thank those who were able to attend our event in NYC on April 1st):

…just one more thing…

The emanations of ‘new history’ (events, especially significant ones, that will move the needle and measure in history) are significantly colored by the eyes of the victors and the powerful (who record and propagate them as fact, and myth). This is also true for past history—tales were writ by the strongest and most successful brutes (hopefully to be teased out and contextualized by able interested investigators later).

In a future of online records, all will be their own historians—-for 15 minutes; All will be ‘internet significant.’ AI may end up being the recognizers and appreciators of the ‘internet significant.’

 
 
 Thanks for reading today.

Re: retirement, rather than taking 'another bite at the apple,' why not take a bite at a whole sweet new fruit (low-hanging? Cherry?) and gobble that up?

There are two types of people.  Those who believe there are two types of people…

About the “is this all there is?” of the universe.  If the universe were a balloon, or a magnetic loop, it still doesn’t explain if that is all there is.

In my first class in semantics in high school, where I learned what semantics was, I was very impressed by the statement “He (because it was the editorial HE then) who can define is master!”  That is a very powerful statement that has stayed with me ever since.  I still appreciate it and agree with it but I think it is or should also be nuanced to include that masters also define—including by brute force, propaganda, advertising and manipulation.  …And, money is increasingly becoming a surrogate for mastery/leadership…whether in business, politics and elsewhere.  This is increasingly being splintered by the emergence of major news networks and outlets which create then standardize and reverberate, propogating chosen messages.
He who can define is master!  He who is master defines!

Elements of this are being clearly developed in one of the two books I am reading which were gifts from our recent Canadienne visitors. The Woman They Could not Silence by Kate Mooret is about an apparently intelligent, open-minded woman around 1860 whose increasing open-mindedness clashed with the dogma of her husband, a pastor who had a lot to lose if his wife intelligently and effectively challenged and questioned the religion he was leading--especially if he wasnt smart enough to effectively challenge her back or be seen to 'be able to control' her.  He was able to get her committed to a horrible asylum for ‘trumped up’ reasons that were used by many men to control the women in their lives. The nascent, voodoo psychiatric system was aligned with this. [NOTE: I started my post Med school training in psychiatry and I am a solid supporter of the specialty so I am not dissing psychiatry as if I was a Scientologist.  Psychiatry then was mostly an unscientific tool of the establishment. It is still not perfect but it is a valuable specialty in many parts of the world. Though I’m not so sure about places like Russia.]. At the time in the book, a wife could essentially be institutionalized because her husband wanted that.  The other ever more egregious example is the catch-22 ‘disease’ of ‘drapetomania,’ which I am ashamed to admit that I had never heard of before.  Drapetomania is (wiki) "a bit of racist, pre-Freudian quack psychology. This unusual psychological condition was only observed in black slaves during the early 1800s. Symptoms of drapetomania include a refusal to accept one's Biblically-ordained position as a sort of human livestock and the tendency to head northward at high speed in the middle of the night. The cure, unsurprisingly, was to rough up any slaves that show symptoms until symptoms disappear."  Basically, oppressors determine that if the oppressed don’t want to be oppressed, they are mentally ill and need PT ('physical' therapy).  What can be more power-mad and self-serving than that?

Rule of Thumb	-originated as a law by Sir Francis Buller in 1886 saying that a man could beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb.

History teaches us so much but it doesn’t really help us to understand the adaptive conditions and states of mind that didn’t drive people to want more or better. Why/how people tolerated so much, inured to what were probably considered the random godless whims of earlier fated times…is hard to understand…yet it still happens in some ways today.  This is probably true for most of us in ways we won't understand until our general lot is further advanced as progress marches.  For example, most of us middle aged and older probably grew up in some ways accepting that some kind of irrational 'hysteria' (not really the correct term but meaningful because psychological hysteria in women was thought to be due to the 'wondering uterus' (and hyter- is the same root in both circumstances)) was associated with pre-/peri-menstrual behavior which might be considered irrational or similar.  I think this was a folie a deux for both males and females.  Similarly, people who are truly mentally ill and act abnormally and their families/caregivers do not benefit from everyone acting as if nothing is wrong.  Families with ill, dysfunctional members are frequently dysfunctional families--in part at least because of consequent familial maladaptive behavior.



Jerry Springer died, per his manager Bradley Springer. I guess he’s no longer a springer chicken.

April 26, the last day of the first month of my retirement.


Retirement so far has begun much better and easier than I expected.  Margie and I are solidifying a pleasant, intimate start over coffee (which she usually makes for me) and tea  (which I usually make for her), sitting together, chatting, watching a bit of news and weather.  She usually interrupts when Roobie, our red male carnival, hears her voice and flutters down to the window, grill, cart or top of the porch umbrella.  They resume their increasingly tender Pavlovian tete-a-tete when she brings out a little cup of food and talks tenderly, almost maternally, to him (and now also his mate, Brunella, who he sometimes mouth feeds)—protecting his food by staying nearer than any of the other animals are comfortable (chipmunks Chips and Salsa;squirrels Whiteye Bulger, Bullseye, Rocky or Upton; the growing unknown rabbit family; the other birds (juncos, wrens, finches, woodpeckers, grackles and the big, loud blue jays) as well as the occasional turkeys.

I have not missed work, to my surprise and I spend much less time in email, which is a great timesaver.

I’ve been very regularly and increasingly reading (finished Stoker’s Dracula today, which I finally read for the first time.  Ive been reading multiple books at once and finished 3 books so far this week—all worth reading.  I continually read a bit of (and about) James Joyce’s Ulysses among others. Somewhere to be placed on the list are Frankenstein and The Man of La Mancha, both of which I’d begun reading within the last few years but didn’t get very far in either.  I hope that my life’s span exceeds completing one book per week of the many, many books I have/want to read.  That would guarantee a long, conscious, informed and interesting life.  Here’s a brief shoutout to our recent ‘northern Liverpudlian’ visitors—part of a lobe of our extended eccentric family, for their kind and stimulating visit…and especially the ‘brain fire starter’ books they gifted us (which I am reading two at this time AMONG the others I am reading).

I’ve been  swimming about 1/2 hour almost every day (at least 5 times a week).  Like many, I’m an ‘upper body’ swimmer and am seeing the increased definition in my upper torso and the increased strength and endurance in my stroke. A Swmp3 makes the swims more interesting and, though I’ve probably had at least 6–some air and some bone-conduction, none have been perfect and durable and none maintains consistent sound quality, usually due to movement or intra-auricular water (in the ear canal).

I’ve begun working in my studio and painting, but I am not nearly where I want to be with that at this time—something I am slowly working toward though (plan to see a future entry about “OffTh Canvas” in the next few months, with an anticipated first opening of my wonderful studio.

Life continues to be and has been an opportunity to appreciate the wonder, majesty and awareness of luck all around me…and I am very grateful.  Part of my gym practice includes a gratitude meditation in the steam room and sauna, a kind of ejaculatory (as in Catholic prayerful recitation) identification, enumeration and appreciation of the many people and things in my life for which there are far more than I have more than I have the right to have.  Chief among these are the three most important people in my life—Margie and my two sons Alex and Winston.  I’ve been becoming more specific and grateful for what I am calling ‘the eccentric circles of extended family’ (eccentric USUALLY in the sense of not concentric).  I won’t enumerate them now as I am thinking of incorporating them in a near future painting...though I had introduced the concept above.

As someone wrote:  “If I were any better, I’d have to be twins!”

In the past month, we have had a few events.  The one I am most pleased with was the surprise appreciation for Margie in NYC on April 1st at Emilio’s Balloto, thanks to Win’s help.  There was also a surprise for me on retirement day and several trips into the citIes of Boston/Cambridge, including one to our Galleries d’Orsay on Saturday for a Bruno Zupan reception.  

Shefali Agarwal visited us today and it seems likely we will likely go to Paris sometime this summer if we can arrange appropriate house sitting.

An author I’ve been reading revealed that his date of birth is the same of mine, interestingly in a passage about not believing in astrology but feeling more connected to someone of his interest when he learns they are of the same astral sign. He (the author) and I also, of course, have the same astral sign but that means little to me. Contrary to his view, having the same date of birth, is (to me) really an invisible lineation between us.  

I like to read interesting turns of phrases including seeming contradictions like “in praise of blame” and “ to live in a place without boundlessness.”  I like the end of statements to surprise and jar me by their non sequitur unexpectedness, out of place-ness, and counter-intuitivity… though not like a slap in the face or a plunge in an unexpectedly ice cold lake but more like my name whispered breathily and barely heard when no one is around or a subtle slight breath gust across but behind your ear in 3/4 pose.

Vargoladz was interesting and went well tonight. Alex was on a retreat and Win had just finished his day job work. “Retreat”became a recurrent sub-MVP.

Thank you Life, for being a wonderful and helpful colleague. Thank you very much to all the people that enrich it so much!

A few disconnected thought provocatives, most by me, some by others:

Derek Sivers: We’re not actually bound to social norms. We don’t need permission. We don’t need to please everyone.

Yesterday was the Red Wedding episode for cable news hosts, Don Lemon and Tucker Carlson. Both were fired from their major news networks. 

The universe is larger today than it was yesterday, though probably less dense on a 'particles'/(cubic light-year) basis.
The same should be true tomorrow and many tomorrows yet to come.

Similar to the confusing qualities and parameters of the most probable God (including the mundane but curious contradition: is God so powerful that s/he can make something s/he can't lift?  More on this in a later day), the universe holds many many mysteries, the most basic being "is that all there is?" This doesn't seem to be the case because the universe is still growing.  But what (space) is the universe growing into?  If it is larger today than yesterday, where was that additional extra-yesterday's-universe space yesterday?  What is outside of the universe? how can it not be infinite? how CAN it be infinite?  Curved space doesnt account for this comfortably for me.
On the other handa-barberra, as they did make bugs bunny say: "that's all, folks!"

Into everyone’s life a little rain must fall but when it’s your drizzle, it seems gale-force and prolonged. 
There can be thunderstorms of the spirit, maelstroms of the soul. 

Books are rocketships to places, ideas and dreamscapes (inner and outer, far and wide, past, present and future). 
Words are the wings on which we fly. I am greatly enjoying collecting and recording the words we ride. 

When you begin to unconsciously (or worse) think you are more important than your message, you have begun to be dangerous.

There is nothing wrong and everything right with enjoying non-zero sum (NZS) life.

Rather than throwing everything out and starting afresh (which is difficultly impossible anyway), better to take stock and see what is workable enough to retain..at least for the being time. 

Who owns the future?

VARGOLADZ tomorrow


Apr 24

A bit too blandly and with lack of reference to the symmetric (as well as, in fact, the reflexive) property, Why aren’t women equal?  Women aren’t equal but they ARE getting 'equal-er.'

Siblings, like spouses, are occasionally natural rivals. No matter how kindred, no one is identical and souls and stars aren’t always aligned. 

I no longer have a brother but my sisters still do (in me).

A bit more about my early relationship with my closer-in-age sister, Bonnie (who, as mentioned yesterday, instructed me in toilet paper procedures).  Bon was born slightly more than 2 years before me.  She was the apple of my grandfather’s (dziadzia, my mom’s dad as my dad’s father had died in an industrial accident 20 years earlier) eye, supposedly because she was a mała busia ([mow-ee boo-shah], or young person who reminded him of his wife, my grandmother).  When I was born, she was feeling demoted from being the baby of the family.  Dziadzia asked her how she liked her baby brother and she asked him to take me back to the hospital he had to backtrack and convince her to give me a chance.  

She did sort of give me a chance although she did overdose me on St. Joseph’s aspirin for children one summer.  (Not saying this was intentional; as I doubt it was.). I liked the orange taste and one morning she woke me up early and, while I was sitting on a bathroom stool, she fed me about 2 bottles of aspirin.  (This was before Reye’s Syndrome associated with aspirin in children was identified.). Not quite a Prospero and Caliban situation. Fortunately (for me at least), we were discovered and my parents forced me to stay awake, walking in the front lawn, until I got to the ER and had my stomach pumped out. It is conceivable that I could have died then and there and so I personally experienced how easy it would be that there could have been no alternate history which was most of my life. 

Life is precious and fragile—and I continue to be very lucky (even if, perhaps, luck includes the luck to realize that if you seek it, you might find it (luck, that is)…in other words, luck may merely be a state of mind.

Interestingly, when she instructed the process for tush-wiping, she never told me to wipe front to back. Was this before she knew?  Did mom ever teach her that?

Women tend to use more tp than men because they also wipe their ‘small front butts’ after peeing.  When a person feels psychologically ‘dirty,’ does s/he use more tp? Are the two related?  I think not. 

You can be anything—or at least continue in that direction. Sadly, there isn’t enough time to do everything, especially because the process and journey to anywhere takes time.

ThreeSibMammaries:

As mentioned, I was the third of 4 sibs, the youngest (our baby brother, Jim) who died suddenly about 2 years ago. 

Jim and I were very close growing up; partners in crime and creative destruction.  For Christmas one year, we received these really cool electric metal trolleys (before things were ‘cheap’ and ‘made in Japan’) that ran on a flexible plastic track that you could put where you wanted. You turned them on and they flashed lights and whistled while they went on the track. When they got to the end of the track, they automatically reversed directions back and forth. We ‘tied up’ the small hallway in our house, tying the doors to bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen. Soon thereafter one of them broke and we took it apart to, unsuccessfully, try to fix it—never able to use them again. We also got young boys tool kits with small hammers, pliers and screwdrivers. (We usually each got the same gifts with something for us individually as well).  We hammered nails and screwed screws into the drawers of our parents small but quaint dresser (which had glass shelves in the middle between the two small banks of drawers with a cool skeleton key hole shaped mirror on the back (like a cartoon of vanity). Our parents were upset but forgiving, living for years with the dresser that we had marred. 

The younger of my two sisters (Bonnie), who was about 2 years older than me, and I were fairly close. She was older than me by years and some of those things which age differently by gender (dating, for example; her boyfriend Chuck P, who was very easy to really like)).  She and I were bookend years in high school. She sort of advised and protected me. She is also the main reason that I didn’t attend the parochial high school that I was registered to attend (next step to the priesthood and all) because she denigrated it compared to the local public high school from which I graduated 50 years ago this summer. Interestingly, she also left our parochial grade school at grade 6 (Thanks Sister unMerry HemmorrhoidFace) to finish in the local public school (Lafayette) whereas Jim and I spent all 8 years at St Adalbert, the same grade school that my mom attended. I remember Jim and I got Bonnie ‘talked to’ by our dad when once she got angry with us and shockingly shouted up the stairs that we were “fucked up fuckers.”   For some strange reason, Bonnie also told me (verbally, procedurally)  how to use toilet paper for butt wiping post poop…take two connected, fold, wipe with one side, fold in half, wipe, fold, wipe, fold…until nothing left, break through or dirty fingers.

When our elder and first sister, Jeri was probably around 13-14 or so, I was sitting next to her on the couch. She was wearing a turtleneck and opened the neck to look at her pert, pubertal boobs.  Not really thinking or expecting anything, I also stuck my head in her turtleneck and saw her perkiness. I was pre-sacramentalled but of course I knew about sin (which I thought I was committing because of my awkward ogling). Knowing about penance for sins but really knowing prayers, I did the only thing I could think of: multiple repetitive sign’s ‘o the cross (SOTC) as penance—which is funny because the SOTC is really a pre-prayer, kind of like saying “I’m about to start (and also finish) praying. So I was not even really praying…really penancing. Ironic!

I also, later, very hornily asked my mom what a vagina was. She embarrassedly and awkwardly responded “It’s like a small front butt.”

…a small front butt!

Here’s to the delayed recognition of the things we blame for happening to us which, in actuality, happened for us.

April 21

There is so little I actually know, though I am learning a lot every day. 

I had one brother, Jim, who was the youngest of the 4 of us sibs.  We were 13 months apart (separated by a month longer than what I think is called ‘Irish Twins’).  We were very close best friends until I went to high school and then other places without our co-location as I slowly continued, admittedly unintentionally, to hive off from him—and we slowly differentiated. Enlisting in the navy was probably the most significant initial separation  and differentiation.  We never really reconnected anywhere near the closeness of our youth.

Amended From BRB: 
Like most close in age brothers, Jim and I were, almost twin-like, inseparable. At times, however, I strain to call up shared memories.
I suspect this is because our senses of selfhood were intertwined, that we were bound up in a "you" and an "us" and a "we" that hardened into a singular entity over early time that devolved into cleaved separateness united only by intimately desired reconnection which could never be complete. What I do know is that many, relatives and otherwise, made us out to be opposites, good and bad, feminine and masculine, academic and unruly. Perhaps they were simply pointing out the parts of us that bifurcated, in opposition to our drive to enact a sameness that upset liberal norms of individuation. Maybe its a mere psychosocial fact that the lives of close sibs are labyrinthine, like any other social form. 

Nevertheless, Jim and I were collaborators and accomplices, best friends and sometimes rivals. Which is to say that we too were key architects of the world of care that brought us into being.

Most sadly, he died almost 2 years ago, too young to be that old after our re-annealing of holiday gobble greetings but before our adequate reintegration.

April 20  (420)

Billy-Ray Belcourt in  A HISTORY OF MY BRIEF BODY wrote a more interesting kind of disclaimer like I wrote above: 

If I were to rank my aesthetic concerns, ambiguity would come before veracity. As such, some names and identifying features have been altered. What's more, I marshal the forces of poetry and theory to weave not a linear story, which "memoir" typically denotes, but rather a series of stories and analytical scenes into a composite that exceeds the boundaries of my individual life.

He is an NDN, a gay First Nation person and excellent writer who I discovered because our friends, Les Canadiennes, left ua a few books including the above mentioned.  So they have disseminated/transsemminated some of their culture and kindnesses.

NOTE: NDN is clever onomatopeaic shorthand spelling for Indian, a term that some Native Americans in the United States and some First Nations peoples in Canada use to refer to themselves. 

Like many other oppressed people, NDNs were oppressed and surpressed, which is becoming increasingly recognized and explored.

With no offense meant, and perhaps overgenerLizing, Canada is like the Liverpool of North America in that they augment the english with the longg 'o' (oo) sound.

April 19

Wouch!  "Wouch" is my neologism for the day to represent an initially surprising event that is either mostly significantly painful or so obviously painful to someone else that you sense the pain which quickly overtakes and supercedes the surprise.  I created this term today when I discovered that the latest interim CEO of SEAGEN earned about $1 million per day. SEAGEN was just bought by Pfizer, who I think significantly overpaid but as mentioned yesterday, they are rolling in COVID money.

What a surprisingly painful situation that is, crazy money which will ultimately be paid by taxpayers.

Otherwise, today was another very good day.  Our guests left, hopefully to return to Regina--a possibility but not definite due to up to 30 cm or more of snow. It was a special, great trip--marathon, sports, touring, chats, including about James Joyce.

On top of that, we had another fine VargoLADZ stream, with bhelgator and Donnie joining us.  Topics included the "binary dichotomy" of binary vs non-binary, a bit on gender pronouns and sone MVP discussion (mine being about the power of social connectedness).  A lot of pleasant and provocative banter was shared and volleyed across the virtual aisles and nets.

Margie took Julie and Jaime (just confirmed the spelling today) to Cambridge for sightseeing, shopping and luncheon (after a morning of lemon ricotta pancakes).

I just discovered this interesting book today:

Tyranny from Plato to Trump: Fools, Sycophants, and Citizens by Andrew Fiala

Power grabs, partisan stand-offs, propaganda, and riots make for tantalizing fiction, but what do we do when that drama becomes a reality all around us? For a country founded as an escape from British tyranny, the United States seems to have devolved into a land where tyrants rise to power, sycophants blindly follow, and the entire nation suffers.As ancient Greek philosophers warned us, chaotic tragedy unfolds in the absence of reason, and the only cure is a return to wisdom and virtue. America’s founding fathers knew this lesson all too well and dreamed of an enlightened citizenry guided by better-than-ideological dictators. Using contemporary events to illuminate universal human weaknesses, Andrew Fiala charts the perennial history of tyrannical takeovers and the masses who support them and ultimately suffer under their rule. Ultimately, Fiala also points to a solution. Knowing the cyclical nature of tyranny, we can build safeguards against our worst inclinations and keep alive the freedoms our founding fathers envisioned for this.


This was worth saying, despite my quip below:


Not everything that should be said can be said; Not everything that can be said should be said.

We are the tops…
…of dandelions.

The unexamined life may not be worth living (according to Socrates) 
but I must add that the examined life isn’t necessarily the be all and end all, either. 

Pfizer is the first pharma company to post >$100BILLION in revenue (last year)!!!  Mostly, admittedly due to wise and successful investments in COVID treatments, but still!!!  Even though I worked for Pfizer and it is a good company, somehow we have to reign in medical costs.  On a flip side of sorts, almost 1 million US nurses will leave nursing by 2027.  That isn't sustainable either.

An old Cherokee told his grandson, “My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all.”

“One is Evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies and ego. 

The other is Good. It is joy, peace,love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy, and truth.”

The boy thought about it, and asked, “Grandfather, which wolf wins?”

The old man quietly replied, “The one you feed.”

The The Hopkington to Boston (by way of Newton) Marathon is practically done for us.  Julia recently finished ~9111th in under 3 hours and 20 minutes--which was her goal.

It was a cool rainy day and before the race was run, it was described as good conditions to run.  After the race they, the psyche out is done and the talk is now how the runners ran well DESPITE the poor weather conditions.

Kenyans won both the male and female races.  Kipchoge though did not do as well as everyone thought--coning in sixth instead of first.

Overall there was a long stream of runners who went by and even at mile 19 aound us, they almost universally looked like they were keeping goodtime and running without too much difficulty.

Hopefully next year, Win and Alex can be with is to enjoy the event.  

Other than Julia and Jamie, we had no other visitors.  Margie has been shuttling them into Boston for the race, which is complicated a bit by our road being closed for the run.  She has been, as she usually is, a wonderful, attentive, host.  Anyone staying here is lucky...and spoiled.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128755897/232585469-155e366b-449d-4b6d-997f-d273675ee391.jpeg)



April 16

Tomorrow will be a very busy day at Castillo Vargo.

Not only will our road be blocked off so that the marathon can be run safely in front of us, we also need to get our guests into town--one (Julia) by 7:30 so that she can take the bus 26.2 miles to Hopkington to run the race and the second (Jamie) into town after Julia runs by our house so that Jamie can meet Julia somewhere near the finish line.  Julia's sister-in-law is also running the marathon and her accompanying 5 or 6 people might spend some time with us as well.

Julia and Jamie are both professors at the University of Regina (actually rhymes with vagina).  Julia is on staff in kinesiology and below is a link to her discussing this run:

https://youtu.be/BN5eQ0w7KNE

About 30,000 people will run the marathon, including the likely first place male (named, I think Kipchoge) who will probably run it in just over 2 hours.  One of his goals is to run a marathon in under 2 hours but Julia, who is on top of these things, doesn't think this will happen tomorrow.  Although the temperature should be conducive, it will probably rain tomorrow which will likely slow it down. 
I think Kipchoge has a great expression when asked what his next running goal: "I only chase one rabbit at a time."   There's a lesson there for us all.  

There was also an official marathon dog, a golden retriever named Spencer who went viral in 2018 due to a video of him at the side of the road with marathon flags in his mouth.  Spencer died a few months ago and there have been memorials for him this year, too.  Here is a picture of Spencer (and his sister Penny, who died even more recently):

Rest in peace, sweet doggies.  Thank you for your faithful service.


It is mildly interesting to me how we clump to simplify things.  It should really be called 'The Hopkington to Boston (by way of Newton) Marathon," but no one does.

I hope it is a great, safe and successful day for everyone.




April 15

Today is the 10th anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombing. Win, Margie and I lived in the Boston area when that happened and it was a terrifying, unreal week. Margie had been at the site of the first bomb the day before it went off and Boston was essentially on lockdown (sheltering in place) all week. I was concerned about Win because I didn't at first know where he was. He kindly fairly quickly confirmed he was OK, which is a thoughtfulness I hope people generally do.  

It is still a tearful remembrance, especially poignant on a day like today.

The bombing changed Boston and affected us in many ways. Even though all things considered, the number of lives lost and the destruction was relatively minor compared to bombings in other areas (including of course the WTC on 911), Boston lost its immunity and sense of safety. Boston became militarized and the police were the celebrated heroes.

There is quite a well-done movie about the event called "Patriot's Day" by Boston's own Mark Wahlberg.  We will watch it tomorrow with friends who are staying with us and who will run the marathon on Monday. 

Patriots' Day is the April mid-month Monday when the marathon is run. It is a Massachusetts state holiday and frequently, including this year delays tax day until the day after. 

Here's to all patriots, veterans and doers of good deeds, including the health care staff and service staff that helped all of us get through the pandemic. 

Most people are good.

“Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.”
-Arthur Shopenhauer


Julia Totosy and friend arrive today to stay with us for a few days so that Julia can run the Boston Marathon on Monday.

Continuing a bit on the theme of Cat-licks from yesterday, many good cathlic boys, especially those who went to parochial schools (as was and did I), grew up wanting to become priests.  A son becoming a priest was the easiest ticket for cathlick parents to get into heaven, it was better than 'don't cross go,' more like chutes and ladders directly into the welcoming and loving arms of God the father, bypassing St Pete at the gates.  Planning to be a priest was the pride of all catholic parents and the boast of families. I was interested in becoming a priest for quite a while and much longer than most, even after high school, even visiting a few seminaries to check out the life a bit.  But some seminarians were weird and not what I would consider holy.  Some seemed to be running from pregnancy scares (as if becoming a priest would curb your lusts or something--we all see how well that went), some were malicious maybe trying to atone for misdeeds of the past (one of the guys told me that when he and his friends were doing LSD, he would buy burning hot pizza and convince then that it wasn't hot and to eat it quickly so that they would burn their tongues and the roofs of their months on the molten cheese--I'm telling you so really weird stuff. And, of course. there were the sexual perverts and deviates.  I'll talk about them later too.

Ultimately and in some ways similar to why I didn't become an OB-GYN, I realized I couldn't be a priest either.  I had already tasted of the tender feminine love lips and I couldn't not do that forever more.  Concerning why I didn't become an OB-GYN, I was too concerned that the access I would get to so many pleasure portals would either really get me in serious trouble OR I would lose my lust because of some of the pathology that I was likely to see (so it was a kind of a 3 little bears situation--either too hot (seminary) or too cold (OB-GYN)).

Remember too that I wss kind of poor and wanted to get a good higher education--wide ranging but including arts, sciences and philosophy (which I guess I ultimately accomplished). The priesthood was a good way to get a good to great education (albeit for the price of your soul and eternal frustration).  This was very true when I was young and certainly true in the medieval period where priests were god's juniors on earth, pretty much unquestioned despite whatever peccadillos they had.

And for poor women, getting they to a nunnery was one of the few ways they could avoid the trap of marriage, constant pregnancy and being someone's sexual release.  Sadly that was about as good as it got for women.  They were free from marriage, pregnancy and unwanted porking but as free as slaves who were repressed handmaids of the lord, never taken to bed by the bridegroom. And they had to turn the other way when the priests diddled where they shouldn't. The gift/curse that life is generally quite a long time was tough for the religious because the spirit could sublimate for so long but then the rest of life as a repressed servant was tough, too. 

I had nuns as teachers at St Doofus and the Bleeding Fuckin Heart, the parochial grade school I attended.  For the most part, they were bitter with a whiff of BenGay and Vicks Vapo-Rub mixed with the stench of self important entitlement.  And they did some really mean and cruel things to some of the students, too.  Smack their heads against the radiators, make them lick cacti, and, probably most bothersome, they use to have their favorites female students sit at their feet while they were teaching the class and have them scratch and pic their festering leg wounds (which they probably got from when they whipped themselves with palm trees before Easter).

It was a sick situation but you can see why, as mentioned recently...men beat their wives and both beat their kids and nobody did anything about it.  Priests abused whomever they wanted, including the nuns and the priests and nuns took it out on the kids because they could.  Parents rarely believed you if you shared some of the ugly things they were doing.  Sometimes parents would punish you for bringing it up and/or accuse you of causing it to happen.  My parents were never than way, I must say.

So for me personally, the prominence of religion (especially Catholicism) has diministed quite a bit.  The same has been true of societies for the past several hundred years. I am a bit ashamed to realize that I was not a more open minded inquisitive questioner over a large part of my life.  I am utterly amazed that many historically did this.

As Matthew Arnold wrote in Dover Beach (on of my many favorite poems, slightly truncated):

The eternal note of sadness …

The Sea of Faith

once at the full, 

round earth's shore Lay  

like the folds of a bright girdle furled.

But now only 

melancholy, long, withdrawing,

Retreating to the night-wind,

And naked shingles of the world.

On a little lighter more intiniate side, as we'd recently talked about partners, consider this interesting quote from Ulysses:

"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me" 


or this tender song by Neil Diamond:

"Is this everything?
If so, was this the only everything ever?"
--DV


On Cathlicism (as promised):

I grew up in a lower middle class conservative Catholic family in the midwestern USA during the boom years post WWII, pre Vatican II and pre evangelicism.
The Catholicism I grew up in was a lot like global Catholicism, I think...certainly what I think of Irish Catholicism from my readings (especially Joyce, Eugene O'Neill (Irish American) and Bruce Springsteen (Irish-Italian-Dutch-American)).  It as a cathlicism of male dominance, especially priestly 'lordship' as vicars of Christ, subservience of women (nuns as handmaids to the lord), very confusing sexual repression and guilt connected with forbidden contraception and absolute rejection of abortion often resulting in very large families with babies every year until the uterus wore out, wife and child beating at which people just looked the other way because that was just the way it was and it was none of your business, alcoholism (for everyone, though in general the alcoholism more of a man thing), depression, restriction and sadness. Reading Joyce, especially POTA and Ulysses gives me the sense that, like me, he struggled with Catholicism although he was better able than I to overtly at least recover and move on  from this other (besides history) "nightmare from which I am trying to awake."   Or, from Finnegans Wake: “He is cured by faith who is sick of fate.”

This cathlicism, the one true and apostolic faith of our fathers,  got deep under your skin and was so fat soluble that it would never really leave until your dead corpse was cremated (which was also not allowed because it would interfere with the 'resurrection on the third day").  You couldn't 'do a GOOP' and consciously uncouple from cathlicism.  Even if you realized you couldn't support the positions of the church (on gays, women's rights, abortion, etc.), it was difficult, bordering on impossible, to think of yourself as the non-catholic (and, at most 'merely' spiritual, at least agnostic, but non-religious).  You still try to see if others you somehow admire are 'also Catholic' so that you can feel that invisible bond with them.  Your default is that you are catholic, even if you consciously know that you are not.

“Once a Catholic, always a Catholic,” as Bruce Springsteen said.  “I don’t participate in my religion but I know somewhere… deep inside… I’m still on the team.” 

It was a cathlicism of learning the rules, suffering to follow them (even in some ways 'glorying' in the suffering of the path), to try to please a god that noone really knew or could figure out--not unlike children of an alcoholic father.  It was not really a happy religion but rather one of going to church because otherwise you'd go to hell; going to mass and communion of at least 9 sequential first Fridays and first Saturdays (of sequential months) in the hope/belief that somehow Mary or someone would make sure you were heaven-ready when you died.  It was a time of prayers every morning and every evening; rosaries, incense and gothic spookiness.  It was not an especially happy religion but it was an indoctrination in the superiority of believing that you were of the 'true believers' and that everyone else was probably going to hell.  Our God may not have been a god of wrath (that god belonged to the jews and 'other' heathens (of course I don't mean jews were heathens (and i'm not really sure what a heathen or pagan was anyway)  but it was the prevailing view of the catholics) but he wasn't a friendly loving god that you wanted to hang out with or have watching over you.  This was the 'cleaver' god...the god who was carefully watching each one of us and the unclear but rigid path he set for us, just waiting for one of us to 'color outside his lines' so that he could have the fun of chopping us to bits with his cleaver, as fun for him and as a warning to every other confused, fearful follower.

It was a time of Purgatory (a place where the unbaptised babies went, never understanding how or why or what was fair about that)...and Saint Christopher, later de-canonized or something into 'Mr. Christopher,' still a good guy and helper of travelers, but no longer a saint (for some reason I never really understood-->was he found out to be a predator so he had to be demoted?  In general, the goal was to BE canonized to be a saint so I've never really understood why they went through the unnecessary effort to demote this guy from the third century--I'll bet he's in non-existent purgatory now, too).


in other words, to flip Charles Dickens:  It was the worst of religions in the worse of religions.


NOTE: A very long ago, in an earlier century, one of my sisters acted what might be considered anti-Cathollic (and certainly rebellious) and as a consequence, my mom 'demoted' her to 'non-sister' for a few years while she was living away from the family.  That is all past now but it was a scary period when you knew your mom could simply wish away (by edict) your existence and connection.


So, in honor of the catholicism of my milieu, I would like to share a link to the following song by Johnny Rivers, aptly perhaps named "Muddy River."

April 12, post VARGOLADS.  Thanks to Donnie and Italianmafia for joining us.

Concerning mothers, although I don't entirely agree with this interesting quote from A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I do think that it generally applies:
"Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother’s love is not."

Of the ~ 20 partners I've had in my life time, 3-4 of them had comparable appetites as I did and that was wonderful.  One of them was a woman who was a college senior when I knew her who was living with me for a while.  She used to stay up late studying and come to bed, waking me up by nakedly 'bouncing up and down' on my pogo stick.  Always great to be awaken that way.  That was special.  

She also gave me my first copy of Ulysses (which I still have, very dog-earred though it be) so she clearly has permanently influenced me in several important mind and body ways that I will always remember.  Thanks, Augustina!

Interestingly, a similar response to unilaterally initiated night bonking doesn't generally apply to female partners (from my experience, at least).  In other words, when a female partner loves you so much that she says she wants you as much as you want her and that she is available anytime you want, DON'T think that includes while she is sleeping.

DON'T unilaterally initiate night sex with her while she is sleeping. The fact that she is sleeping could be considered a hint that she is not interested at that moment in being raw dog impaled from behind (it's usualy easier from behind). If you do this, she is never moist enough and really receptive.  Afterwards, you are dopamined and oxytocined easily able to doze off to sleep in heavenly peace, and she is wide awake, damp, unconfortable (likely even sore, you selfish bastard) and NOW SHE WANTS TO SHARE (e.g., TALK ABOUT, aka 'complain') about THAT EXPERIENCE WITH YOU as you further piss her off by continuing to nod off.  Better to take a cold shower (which I don't actually recommend unless you are Wim Hopf) or a mono-a-mono tug.


There are many, usually poorly understood stages of the developing sexual relationships including rapacious, ravenous, constant, residual and oh! darn!!!  (Though not necessarily in that order.)  Eventually you realize that it is not a choice between sex and eating, but rather a sequencing decision.  The sooner you learn that, the better off you will be. Eventually you will realize you can have and eat your cake, er, pie.


...and now a message about brotherhood of sorts:

We are not helpless, we are men...
All are strangers,
All are friends,
All are brothers:

Aprill 11--Note that as of 11 AM today, I altered yesterdays entry a bit as well.

From nothing to nothing and the nothingness in between...

I don’t believe in the impossible (except conceptually)

O Fortune, you are fickle as the moon, always waxing and waning;
this miserable life first wrecks, then cures at a whim; 
poverty and power melt like ice. 
Fate, you monster of emptiness, you malevolent whirling wheel- 
happiness is in vain, and always fades away.
   Orff’s Carmina



Ah! Sex!

I estimate that i have probably had about 20 sexual partners (involving AT LEAST but usually more than mutual nakedness, frottage or some orgiastic experience, usually shared (sequentially but sometimes simultaneously) by both).  Most but not of this was serial monogamy, sometimes serial agony.  Concerning night stands and hat stands, one night stands were very rare...though they occurred, usually with someone I otherwise knew before...and afterwards (though sometimes getting grief afterwards).  My youngest partner was probably 15 when we began our intermittent dalliance.  The oldest was twice my age (le'ts just say she was older than 50).  That didnt end well primarily because after a few times together, I replaced her with a much younger (age congruent) partner.  Though she was a very liberal and educated older woman, I was surprised at how inexperienced she was...even shocked when i added a very slight hint of spice to our vanilla though we were still quite mainstream. It surprises me to realize it is very likely she has died of old age by now (or maybe the rapture of ecstacy?).  

Few of the women were virgins (how archaic is that concept?)...and in each case, I did not 'deflower them' (again, sorry for the medieval botanical reference).  The only non-white (in this case black) woman was a virgin who really seemed to wanted to go all the way but i felt too responible to so casually do that.  But, had I, we likely would have ended up in a longer term relationship--which could have been very nice; I think we were novelties for each other.  (And I realize from chatting with others and from movies that some girls really just 'want to get it over!')  Most though not all were North Americans.  There were several jews, mostly christians and/or spiritual at least.  I am unaware if any were muslim, Wiccan (though some ended up being real witches), or other Eastern religions.  Other than marriage, the longest, which was intermittent, probably lasted 8 years end to end with actual total time as a couple being 3.25 years.  There are at least 3 women (not included in the estimated 20), probably a lot more, that I regret not successfully pursuing more aggressively.  As is known, though, I was  was raised conservatively Catholic which means that I was required to confuse love with lust and have to convince myself I was in love before I could have sex.  The first time I was manually pleased, I literally shook all night because of my Catholic guilt.  The kind and gentle deliverer of such confusing ecstacy was afraid she had seriously hurt me in some inexplicable way.


My first boner fide sexual experiences were with a manatee, a chubby spongy walrusy (though not ‘mousy’ except for certain ‘dies di mens’) girl on the girls swim team. It was our high school girls team so not everyone was in peak shape and form (and it took me years to appreciate the efforts of these cornfed fatbergs. As Paul Simon sang in Capeman, “like a ton of corned beef floating in beer.”)  My friends called her ‘manatee’ (sea cow) because of her rotund aquaphilia. She’d had her nose fixed after smashing on the side of the pool in a flip turn (which, sadly likely cost her the only school pool record she was ever going to get—such the cost of too much effort).  As a consequence of the nose mash, her sense of smell wasn’t good—although, unless she smelled like the chlorine in the pool, she usually smelled great (probably a bit overdone because she ‘overtitrated’ due to the nose thing). That being said, she almost always tasted great BUT there was something especially wonderful about the salty taste of her labia after swim practice. We were quite into 69, I think primarily because she was preserving her virginity for an unknown trigger later (which ended up…to my great dismay being xxx right around the time we were ending because she was mad at me and wanted to punish me [which worked very well let me tell you]).  Anyway, I thought she was comfortable gobbling on my stinky schmegmatoous flagrant rampant (to use, I think Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint) throbbing cock, spewing its foul hot mushroom milk because, due to her nose job, she couldn’t taste. Interesting afterwards, to sometimes smell YOUR COCK on your bedmate's breath.  Seems though since then, I’ve learned that she…and a fair percentage of woman…ACTUALLY DO LIKE TO SUCK COCK.  There is never the ceasing of wonder!

Most heterosexual want to have their cocks sucked…most gays and women apparently yet inexplicably like to succock.  
And I have never been with a pussy that I didnt' find pretty, tasty, erotic and pleasing.  
It wasn’t until the last 15 years or so that I could use the words “pussy” or “cock” with a partner and ask her to ‘suck my cock.’  Prior to that time, I thought that too rude, too private and inappropriate. But as mentioned earlier, I REALLY like pussy!!! 

It wasn’t until the 21st  century that I began to experience the pubic sculpting, runways, skid marks, goatees up to and including the cantatrice chauve of the modern woman’s eschutcheon…and I’m up for it all. Beavers, snatches, coinslots, gossamer Hymenoptera…you name it. I can’t get enough. 

There was a joke when I was in my 20’s and 30’s—

Q:  What is the last sound a pubic hair makes?  
A:  Pffffttt! (e.g., the sound of being spit out.)

I kept experimenting with flavored and aroma’d (flavored) crotch shampoos/soaps/colognes (cockolones) to see if there was anything that would get a special “that tastes great” reaction to no avail.  I even experimented with flavored food to see if they had an effect though I never found one. I guess it isn’t the taste but the experience.

But then I realized that few really like or focus on the taste. It’s the Lusty erotic desire and/or driven obsession to be there and to share that is the be all end (all). Few are really in it for the taste. The lust center and obsession so overdrives the gustatory center.

Italian women’s netherlips  are slightly gar licky; French women’s clams are oysters in garlic.  Most Jewish women appreciate if you 'challah' down the canyon.  I especially like the taste of freshly washed and dried labia... perhaps with a little chianti!


…To quote Samuel Beckett: "Thats how it is on this bitch of an earth"


and, per Bruce Springsteen, With Every Wish:

These days I sit around and laugh
At the many rivers I've crossed
But on the far banks there's always another forest
Where a man can get lost
Well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides
Guiding us 'cross to another river on the other side
And there someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes
And though my heart's grown weary
And more than a little bit shy
Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst
And leave the angels to worry
With every wish (there comes a curse)

April 10

My love language is humor and surprise


PhD, GHD’s brother died Easter yesterday In Catania. RIP

So did Logan Roy…and so many people seem to care though in Logan’s case…really???  Get a life.

We often conflate excuse and explanation for cause. Any reasonable, rationale person frequently does this in the ongoing learn (and ideally learn and confirm) iterative process. Very rational, very Humean.  This can be very difficult is times of seismic (even if slow, with jiggly bits) shift.

That is where I am teetering with respect to the active male support of women’s rights, which I call “malefemnism” because I do think men will likely never completely understand what it means for women to be equal. That’s why I call it Malefemnism — because it is a male (and imperfect, ergo the mal—> bad) femnism (incomplete feminism).  I propose that most people agree that men are practically the dominant sex...And, it is unlikely men will ever be so omniscient that they will ever cede to complete parity...that is a bridge just a bit too far.

I consider myself an active supporter and attempted to understand this equality but I admit it is imperfect and in some ways uncomfortable because I’m still a bit insecure in it. Although I came of awareness in the second wave of femnism, I get confused with the “pronoun” titles miss, mrs, Ms. (Of course there’ they/them, etc., but that largely a different though similar story entirely.)

I was very close to my mom growing up and saw her working ALL THE TIME (seemingly) whereas I knew my dad worked hard at his job (and I saw many of the scars and burns he received at work).  But then he came home, did a few jobs as necessary but could relax where my mom never seemed to stop.  That seeming inequity is my early entry into feminism.

Puberty and the Catholic Church kind of messed some of that up for me.  There is something about the female body (this is instinctive, reactive, semi-automatic, I think)—especially the naked body or the braless, nipples blaring tight top (and  many of the other revealing 'coverings' what seem to me to be uncomfortable yet so provocative they push the perve autopilot button) that makes men (at least me) mindless. Love lust sex pleasure procreation, mostly admittedly selfish pleasure—some combination of that and others and feminism is very difficult to rationally support at those times…even as a malefemnist.  Some other “animal brain” which rapidly cycles fast and slow takes over—it’s like the little devil on your left shoulder knocking out the little angel on your right shoulder with sleeping gas.

How/why did this inequity ever come about?  There are no causes but I think I have some postulative explanations, including though not necessarily in any definitive order:

x Women are physically smaller and weaker…better to be subservient than always at unknown risks;

x The obvious physical changes that occur at puberty…triggering male urges and brainlessness  mentioned above

x The male sexual equipment, protruding, penetrative (and relatively quick to erect and be satisfied) vs the inner hidden receptacle of the female…historically a secondary consideration for pleasure (if a consideration).  The external dangling male member is also, because it dangles and jiggles, somewhat self stimulating, making it easy to be further aroused by the female. Once the male has been satisfied, there may not have been the reciprocation of pleasure, perhaps not even the knowledge or desire for it.  (It takes a long time for the male to control himself for mutual pleasure—especially when the ‘heat oft5he moment’ gets uncontrollably hot. (In fact, I sometimes wonder if orgasm is actually pleasurable (I really think it very much is) or merely so programmed, instinctive and automatic that the experiencer isn’t really aware (during as well as anytime after) but goes through a series of mind-altering neurobiological, neurochemical, neurohormonal, neuropheromonal and other mind altering, mind numbing alterations and gyrations which in themselves imbue the experience with a recollection of intense pleasure and the reinforcing mindless urgency to do it over and over…perhaps similar if not identical to rats, cocaine and dopamine? One has to wonder if dpoamine was so named because it turns post-orgasmic man into a dopey character.

x The ability/risk of getting pregnant and pregnancy itself--which can elicit protectiveness and vulnerability--not to mention the miraculous element of the process

x Childbirth, including (historically) high maternal and infant mortality

x Lactation with its seemingly natural purpose and benefits but which keep mothers down (also enhancing the female frontal contour)

x The likely frequent feminine social and emotional abilities to keep peace vs the male “catch and kill” competition.  Even now, boys play at war with Toy soldiers (winners and losers), whereas girls play with their Barbies socializing at tea.  [I know that some of this may be contemporary societal programming.]
(I think it was Margaret Atwood who wrote: no matter how high the tech, Homo sapiens remains at heart what he's been for tens of thousands of years -the same emotions, the same preoccupations, the same good, bad, and ugly. Were a mixed bag, we humans.
The genetic familiarity in offspring which keep fathers invested…and protective.
etc…

I do believe that, in general, progress is being made though it is staccato, backsliding intermittently and, with the repeal of Roe v Wade and the recent judgement by a Texas judge’s ruling on the abortion medication mifepristone.  Having worked in the pharma industry for most of my career, this seems like significant and worrisome judicial overreach which can happen when there is maliscious intent.  The FDA approves drugs, including the approved indications. The judiciary doesn’t have anything to do with this, which is a rigorous scientific review process.  It seems similar to if a Texas judge decided that Jeff Bezos foundation loses its tax benefits (leaving other foundations unaffected).
It’s like boiling a frog…losing rights slowly, so slowly that you don’t recognize it until it is too late. 

...And its worrisome.

"Sinned by Dev'lish"© Dennis Vargo, 2023.


The following topics to be elaborated on over the next few days: Malefemnism, con/tra/ception, the lowerarchy and Catholicism in context

More on mom: 
1. although they weren't called such at the time, mom's "love languages" were service, deprivation and sacrifice
2. her main nutrition group was caffeinated beverages: hot lipton (or cheaper) teabag tea in the morning and one  16 oz bottle of pop at a time  which she had us buy from from Wiltz, local store, to which we would walk for her, usually alone.

THE ORIGIN OF LAUGHTER by John Updike
(after Desmond Morris)

Hunched in the dark beneath his mother's heart, 
The fetus sleeps and listens; dropped into light, 
He seeks to lean his ear against the breast 
Where the known rhythm holds its secret pace.



Slowly, slowly, through blizzards of dozing, 
A face is gathered, starting with the eyes--
At first, quite any face; two painted dots 
On cardboard stir a responsive smile. Soon 
No face but one will serve: the mother's, 
A mist, a cloud that clearly understands.



She teases him, pretends to let him drop.
He wants to cry but knows that she is good.
Out of this sudden mix, this terror rimmed 
With necessary flesh, a laugh is born.





April 7

Although my mom was upper or mid lower class, she grew up in a place, space, culture and time when men beat their wives who then joined them in beating their kids propagating a viscous (in both senses of the term) cycle. (This did not happen to her and us but it happened all around us and no-one did anything about it.). This was a time when priests preyed on parochial students (which I know from personal experience).
There was definitely a double standard—a situation I am afraid we may be returning to with a razor thin political divide that even though it is about equally women, the women on each side seem to think (or don’t think) differently—especially when it comes to women’s rights. (As I write this, a Texas federal judge is halting the FDA approval of abortion pill mifepristone and Roe v Wade was recently overturned).  Her father “allowed” her to go to high school even though his mates mocked him for wasting education on a girl. So her way out, was to get married (and work). 
  She did get married and had 4 kids: 2 older girls and then 2 boys, me being the older son. My mom remarked at how attentive my dad was to her while she was in the hospital with the girls but when I was borne he wasn’t. Rather, he was out calling all family and friends to brag “I have a son!” My dads name was Frank and I was supposed to take that name as a family tradition for the first born male. Instead she named me something different. 

My mom was dutiful but not happy and I think she got increasingly depressed as she felt trapped in her increasingly constricted situation.   I know that she didn’t enjoy sex (at least that’s what my sister told me. I also know that I wasn’t breast fed, resulting in my brother being born 13 months after me. She slowly stopped taking care of herself, smoking more and drinking (beer) regularly and alone, reminiscent of Picasso’s The Absinthe Drinker.  She cooked for us and was very clean, pinning her hair with Bobby pins every night before work. But she barely ate the food she cooked and seemed to subsist mostly on Pepsi (or Coke), tea with real lemon juice. She also became increasingly isolated, not wanting to see others or even talk on the phone. She went to church religiously (as required) but always stayed in the back of the church. She was a compliant but nominal catholic. 

She didn’t want to socialize or travel but rather stayed at home drinking and smoking later and later into the night.  My dad supplied her booze and ciggies but increasingly stopped being with her during these periods. She became increasingly unhealthy. 

She worked until she had her first small stroke. My dad had retired earlier and he was looking forward to their traveling but that never really happened because of her stroke. She had a nearly fatal stroke while I was out of contact, moving to Chicago from Indianapolis. She spent several months in the hospital and then several years wheelchair bounds, right-side paralyzed and unable to speak. She should have faded away at home but my dad freaked out when she became comatose. I took her to the ER where she was hospitalized, dying of urosepsis a few hours later. She died about 10 months after Alex was borne. Winston never met her. 

I wish life had been much better and more fair to her. I loved her and she deserved so much more. She wanted to be a nurse or a teacher…I’m not sure she wanted to be a parent. I am mostly sad when I think about her life. 


April 6

You can't go home again, said Thomas Wolfe--but you can retrieve the past by writing about it. (Margaret Atwood)

Yesterday I wrote mostly about my dad. Today I will mostly explore my more complex and complicated relationship with my mother

To be at least a good mother must be the hardest of the very common jobs with the largest membership.  On top of everything else every other class of person does, a mother has to use her uterus, vagina and brain not just for pleasure but also for nurturing, maintaining and propagating the species while being inconvenienced, sleep-deprived and semi-(at least)-incapacitated for a duration much beyond the gestational and lactational through to educational, recreational, differentiational,  separational and much beyond.  The job never really ends although it frequently does transmute into a positive bidirectional symbiosis.

And the sons in their lives become especially attentive to and protective of the mother.  I for example once literally left my cousin on the side of the road in Rhode Island when he accused my mother of cheating at cards (canasta) but would not support the accusation with any examples. I mean, c’mon…canasta?

(I guess when it comes to “fightin’ words,” moms can easily defend themselves probably better than we can but “fightin’ words” are really trigger words to provoke confrontation…and I responded.)

As Margaret Atwood also wrote, the pen is mightier than the sword, but only in retrospect: at the time of combat, those with the swords generally win.…and, I add, when push comes to shove, men will do most of the shoving and women will be the ones most pushed around. 


The bond between a mother and her child is even more individualized and unique than is the bond between a mother and her children. i always thought that I was my mom's favorite but so did each of my sibs.

My mom could, and did, ease my cares and fears even if she had to lie (not that anyone would consider her to be a liar, because she wasn’t).  One night when I was about 9 years old, I was night terrorized by the overwhelming knowledge that I was going to die that night.  I came crying uncontrollably to her and she simply said that everything was going to be okay.  I was able to sleep that night and all the nights afterward.  After knee surgery, between confused spasms of returning consciousness, somehow I knew she was there with me, poking me in the back and saying, “mom’s here, mom’s here!”

Overall she was the axis around which my young self revolved into maturity in its comfortable orbit.  As I got older, I started to realize she was an independent person with thoughts, dreams, likes, a history and a societally imposed composition of roles, foibles, demons (image in au pair book shelf) and habits (both positive and self-destructive)…and I wondered why there seemed to differences in the way men and women were treated and the different expectations imposed upon them.  Whereas my dad left home to work all day every weekday, she worked away at various jobs but also seemed to be always working at home as well—cooking, washing, cleaning and so forth.

…to be continued tomorrow,



April 5

In praise of a father.

My dad was a fairly simple though very curious, mostly self-taught guy who loved life, his four kids and naively believed in the power of education. He was also devoted and dedicated to his wife (my mom) taking care of her in his clumsy clunky way after her severe debilitating stroke which, because it’s resulting depression and paranoia, caused her to be angry and mean to him and to openly call the neighbor a bitch for having an affair with him—neither of which were true. In her post stroke angry paranoid confused state, she was physically abusive to him, too, kicking and slapping him. To be fair in very small part he encouraged her to try to hit him with her withered, stroke-shrunken right arm—his best awkward attempts to get her some physical therapy.

Both of my parents were of lower middle class Eastern European, Catholic descent.  My mom's parents were born in Poland and my mom grew up in an American Polish 'ghetto' with Polish being her first and only language (until she went to school at the local parochial grade school {which I also attended}.  My dad's mom was born in America of Polish immigrants and his father was from Hungary.  This was an issue when my dad met my mom's father (dziadzia in Polish) in that my dziadzia was unwilling to meet my dad at first because of his last name (which was Hungarian).  Dziadzia supposedly said that if my dad was not polish, he may as well be a Jew. (I include this only as a reference to my background as mentioned yesterday.)   

Ironically, our last name really isn't hungarian but is probabaly not our real name but an Ellis Island artifact. The was a very unsettling realization when I learned (about 20 years ago) that my identity (at least the identity I associated with the heritage of my last name) was false.

My dad's early circumstances weren’t easy. Being of mixed parents (Polish AND Hungarian), they spoke english in his house and he failed second grade because he couldn’t speak Polish (the laanguage of his parochial school) so he couldn’t really learn or succeed in school. His father died due to an industrial accident at the Studebaker factory which probably ruptured his liver and/or spleen, telling my dad with his dying words that he ‘was now the man of the family,’ and to take care of his mom and his multiple younger siblings.  My dad was 13 at the time so he dropped out of high school to support his mom and his sibs.

He was a gently guy with dreams and desires and the drive for continual self-improvement.  He worked his way up and out including stoking his wanderlust by leaving landlocked northern Indiana and joining the WWII US Navy.  And...he read a lot.

After the navy, he met my mom as they were on separate bowling leagues.  She was attracted to him even though he was kind of from the 'other side of the tracks.'  Although my mom's family was by no means wealthy, my dziadzia was a grocer so they always had food, cigarettes (my mom's vice which contributed to her illnesses) and a car.  My mom always said she had better off suitors but she somehow fell in love with "poor Fxxxx Vzzzz" a comment that always hurt my feelings when she told me.

After leaving the navy and being a married father, although he never graduated from high school, he got his GED and took home study courses in auto mechanics. He took swimming lessons when I was in kindergarten.  I remember going to the natatorium with the younger of my two sisters and our younger brother while he learned to swim.  Although he never went to college, he expected all of his children to get higher degrees because we were 'college material' (as our teachers told him, which made him beam with pride).  He had a continual desire for improvement and betterment and was optimistic to the core.

Because his circumstances were meager, he always worried about money.  I unfortunately picked that up from him too.  Ironically, perhaps, he had a lust and zest for life and didn't want it to end.  He developed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia in his 80's and minimized how it intruded in his life.  He wanted to get a bone marrow transplant in the hopes of being cured but he was too old at the time to justify the risk (according to the doctors---he was willing if it gave him a chance for a cure).

There are many things I picked up from my dad and I cherish:  My own wonderlust, my desire to continue to learn and improve, my getting a college degreee and an MD, my love of swimming and, especially, the love of my sons.  Like in many families, I am sure, my dad was the softie and my mom was the disciplinarian.  I am very grateful to him for all of that.

I also remember when my dad would play with my sons when they were young.  He would get on the floor and play with them in a fun, funny non-pretentious way that reminded me of what a wonderful, acceptable and forgiving father he was to me.

Being an american male from the WW era, he didn't tell us he loved us very much...but we knew he did.

I wish he were stil here because I would value his way of being, his kindness and gentleness and his positivity.


April 4

I had no real experience with Jews growing up except the inappropriate and wrong view of them as alien, untrustworthy, shrewd.  

“Jew” was a noun, adjective and verb. That being said, I was never brought up to think of Jews as Christ Killers.

I have certainly matured in this respect at least.  I went to Brandeis University, Almost married a Jewish Brandeisienne and have many very close Jewish friends.  

In addition, as I have moved to various places, I have probably belonged to 4-5 Jewish Community Centers, primarily to swim in their pools.  This includes my current membership at the JCC of greater Boston (Newton), where I probably swim 6 times a week.  We do wear swim caps like in Woody Allen movies.  Of interest, my current JCC has a lot of really old, crumpled, hunched members so, even though I recently retired, I still feel young in that crowd.  

Tomorrow begins Passover which means the JCC is closed for the next 1 1/2 days for the eight-day Jewish holiday which commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.  In Hebrew Passover is known as Pesach (which means “to pass over”), because God passed over the Jewish homes, saving the Jews, when killing the Egyptian firstborn on the very first Passover eve.

Sadly, in the last year and a half of membership, the JCC has had at least 2 bomb threats…which is unfortunate, frightening and representative of the increasing anti-semitism in most parts of the world, including the USA.

The New England Patriots owner Robert Frost via his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism—introduced the blue square emoji as a symbol of solidarity with the Jewish people as part of the #StandUpToJewishHate campaign.  I support and endorse this. (As an aside, Robert and his recently deceased first wife, Myrna, were great supporters of Brandeis causes.  He probably still is.)

April 3rd

I just started a new, separate thread holding the pictures from Margie's party, which you can goto if you select the "Vargodl" at the top left of this page.

Today was a further 'returning to our "new" reality--home with an increasing sense of technological home security.  Margie may have mentioned that we had 'bigfoot' apparently come to visit us (aka case the joint) a couple of weeks ago. courtesy of snowfall, we saw his yeti tracks and became concerned about security--we have many windows (although new, secure and casement) and doors which are protective, but wont keep out someone with the need to enter.

Over the past weeks since biggie oggled, we've significantly upgraded our security--now with motion detectors, lights, videocameras, sirens as well as central monitoring (re-initiated) and non-denomininational space lasers which remotely inject Bill Gates' most uptodate-but excruciatingly painful, GPS tracking chips into the buttocks (and, in fact, the bollocks, if they are present) of unwanted uninvited visitors.

Security is important especially as we occasionally leave our kitties over night though we have the capability to see them on the little remote screen now.

We are very fortunate to have some nice stuff and live in one of the safest places around Boston.  Nonetheless, "some nice stuff" sometimes attracts the riff and the raff.  But we don't want to be owned by our possessions.

2 April

Recently back from NYC and a quick but very pleasant and (if I might say so) very successful surprise weekend for Margie. I am so very grateful for all who came to the city to share. It was inconvenient for everyone but I think everyone had a great time and would do it again. I am so especially grateful to Winston for helping to make it happen. 

Margie and I love each other very much and made the new vow to "never not" love each other.

1 April--April Enchantment (instead of Fools) Day

A wonderful surprise for my fantastic wife. 

Dinner with dear friends Pauline, Louie, Kevin, Abdu, Joanne, Jess, Rich, Stephanie, Stuart as well as Win (who was instrumental in planning and arranging) at Emilio's Balotto in NYC. 

As Scott Galloway says, Life is so rich!

And...as has been increasingly stated, close friends are very important to health and longevity. 

We are blessed with wonderful friends. 

...And, I dearly love my wife. I surprised her today for the wonderful person she is and the important 10 year milestones she has crossed. She similarly surprised me a week ago with a surprise retirement dinner--an ouroboros of surprises. Like "The Gift of the Magi"
by O. Henry. 

Life is so Rich!!!


31 March

I began yesterday with "Expect surprises!" because I like the implied conflict of expecting the unexpected. 

Tomorrow is what many consider April Fools Day but, taking off on the surprise theme, I'd like to advise everyone to expect enchantments--positive surprises!

30 March


"Expect surprises!"  an optimistic oxymoronicum.


BREAKING somewhat interesting national news bits from this pm:

1.) Donny Trump indicted in NY.

2.) The main GOOPette found not guilty for skiing accident in Utah.


...continuing clangingly on the last two onomatapoeiae of kiss and suck:

Lips and anus as extrusions/extensions/extremes of the alimentary canal in humans. Do other animals have or do only humans have protruded lips?  like the anus, the lips are the ends of the alimentary canal which pucker externally.   Animals greet with their noses and tongues but dont 'kiss'.  ...and human kissing is generally an intimate activity.

Many years ago (probably 50, give or take), I drew a self-portrait with puckered lips, remarking the similarity to the anus (maybe it's just me?).  I'll see if i can find that drawing and enter it in a later posting.

A further irony/paradox is that animals (including humans) are tubes within tubes—really ‘outside in’ via the alimentary canal… lips connect anus with a tract (GI) which takes in food and water, extracts what the body needs, excreting the rest/waste.  Food from the outside stays outside the body (in the GI tract as it passes through the body). What passes through the GI tract never ‘enters’ the body. 

Burps, borborygmi and flati are manifestations of the gaseous passengers of the GI tract.

Farts (flati,flatulence) are the funniest though potentially most disconcerting of the three.  Butt they certainly are funny and the stuff of (mostly lowbrow) literature.  Salvador Dali wrote an essay on maiden or virgin farts.  An uncontrolled irregular semi-survey by me suggests that men fart more and louder than do women.  Men BRAAPPP, women 'pert' or 'pweet,' sometimes without even realizing it.

Farts are funny

Farts are fun

Percolating softly 

or rumbling on

  [by me, DV]


“Because of a very long fart, really a very long and, let us be frank, melodious fart, that I produced when I woke up, I was reminded of Michel de Montaigne. This author reports that Saint Augustine was a famous farter who succeeded in playing entire scores.”

Excerpt from Diary of a Genius by Salvador Dali

"Jar of Farts" From Dali's illustration based on the novel; "The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Renowned Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes” by François Rabelais.

...and James Joyce wrote privately to Nora about her gas:
“You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.”

Torque is energy in a twisting motion, which is measured in pound-feet. In another 'n of 1' uncontrolled approximation, I estimate that when farts are torqued into solids (gas is turned into poo-poo, aka shite), the solid excrement also has a pound-foot measure but in this case one shit-foot weighs about one pound avoirdupoisd.  Isn't science amazing?!!!


29 March

streaming with https://www.twitch.tv/vargolads this evening (and most Wednesday evenings) at 6 PM.

More of 'the similar other act' of JJ's APOTA (James Joyce's A Portrait Of The Artist).  The other end/act compared to Kiss of yesterday being "Suck".

  "Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.

  To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing."

...and, clanging on 'suck,' the following quote on Suck sess:

Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Robert Collier


28 March

A day without James Joyce, who ’turned his mind to unknown arts,’ is a day without insightful creative thought. 

F'r'instance, Deshil Commodius Eamus which could, i suppose mean 'The Shield of Commonwealth Amuses.'

Our Commonwealth house (Castillo Vargo) is a very very very fine house with…two cats...
…a bonded feral Siamese rescue pair  [But, as has been previously opined and even bumper stuck, who rescued whom?]

Being a James Joyce fan, I was planning to call them James and Joyce

Being a happily married James Joyce fan, WE call them Leopold and Livia (Leo and Livie).

I am going to call my next pet “Peeves” so I can introduce my friends to ‘my pet peeves.’  Peeves will probably be a turtle, or a unwanted mouse…Slow, dirty, irritating, maybe even infectious (salmonella, rickettsia, ohmygodosis...you name it).  Of course, cats can be fairly peevishly self-possessed and stand-off-ish, too.  Some might consider than part of their allure.

Some of my favourite early Joyce (and first onomatopoeia of 'kiss'), is from A Portrait: "What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?"

Monday, March 27

There is a best (at least in an Anselmian sense). My goal…the beginning of my morning ‘praymeditation’ is to ‘be better for the best!’

Mom101: Today would have been my mother’s 101st birthday.  Happy birthday, Alycce!

The pandemic ended up being an ~ 3 year transition into retirement for me. The whole of 2023 will be, in many ways, the transition into retirement. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have (and could have) retired much earlier. But, working from home, it was convenient to work, AND my wonderful wife made sure I was fed, watered and following safe Covid practices. Overall, especially the last almost 2 years, although I would have preferred no pandemic and although the precautions and isolation were not insignificantly inconvenient, the pandemic period had upsides—regular (and enhanced) reading and swimming, f’r’instance.
It is interesting how some friendships seem to have paused during the pandemic and some have frayed. 

Philosophically and absolutely I non-despondently ponder if there is even the possibility of nothing?


You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Innominal Patriotism is Filling and Spiritually Sanctifying

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live


‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.’”​ — Anthony de Mello​

My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

a lot of special friends and special memories.

Now, I’m thinking 'bout eternity
Some kind of ecstasy’s
Got a hold on me...
