"Expect surprises!"  an optimistic oxymoronicum.

BREAKING somewhat interesting national news bits from this pm:
1.) Donny Trump indicted in NY.
2.) The main GOOPette found not guilty for skiing accident in Utah.


...continuing clangingly on the last two onomatapoeiae of kiss and suck:

Lips and anus as extrusions/extensions/extremes of the alimentary canal in humans. Do other animals have similar or do only humans have protruded lips?  like the anus, the lips seem like they are the ends of the alimentary canal which pucker externally.   Animals greet with their noses and tongues but dont 'kiss'.  ...and human kissing is generally an intimate activity.

Many years ago (probably 50, give or take), I drew a self-portrait with puckered lips, remarking the similarity to the anus (maybe it's just me?).  I'll see if i can find that drawing and enter it in a later posting.

A further irony/paradox is that animals (including humans) are tubes within tubes—really ‘outside in’ via the alimentary canal… lips connect anus with a tract (GI) which takes in food and water, extracts what the body needs, excreting the rest/waste.  Food from the outside stays outside the body (in the GI tract as it passes through the body). What passes through the GI tract never ‘enters’ the body. 

Burps, borborygmi and flati are manifestations of the gaseous passengers of the GI tract.

Farts (flati,flatulence) are the funniest though potentially most disconcerting of the three.  Butt they certainly are funny and the stuff of (mostly lowbrow) literature.  Salvador Dali wrote an essay on maiden or virgin farts.  An uncontrolled irregular semi-survey by me suggests that men fart more and louder than do women.  Men BRAAPPP, women 'pert' or 'pweet,' sometimes without even realizing it.

Farts are funny
Farts are fun
Percolating softly 
or rumbling on
  [by me, DV]


“Because of a very long fart, really a very long and, let us be frank, melodious fart, that I produced when I woke up, I was reminded of Michel de Montaigne. This author reports that Saint Augustine was a famous farter who succeeded in playing entire scores.”

Excerpt from Diary of a Genius by Salvador Dali

"Jar of Farts" From Dali's illustration based on the novel; "The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Renowned Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes” by François Rabelais.

...and JamesJoyce wrote privately to Nora about her gaseous expressions:
“You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.”

Torque is twisting motion, which is measured in pound-feet. In another n of 1 uncontrolled experiment, I estimate that when farts are torqued into solids (poo-poo, aka shite), the solid excrement also has a pound-foot measure but in this case one shit-foot weighs about a pound.  The amazing wonders of science!!!

streaming with https://www.twitch.tv/vargolads this evening (and most Wednesday evenings) at 6 PM.

More of 'the similar other act' of JJ's APOTA (James Joyce's A Portrait Of The Artist).  The other end/act compared to Kiss of yesterday being "Suck".

  "Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.

  To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing."

...and, clanging on 'suck,' the following quote on Suck sess:

Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Robert Collier


28 March

A day without James Joyce, who ’turned his mind to unknown arts,’ is a day without insightful creative thought. 

F'r'instance, Deshil Commodius Eamus which could, i suppose mean 'The Shield of Commonwealth Amuses.'

Our Commonwealth house (Castillo Vargo) is a very very very fine house with…two cats...
…a bonded feral Siamese rescue pair  [But, as has been previously opined and even bumper stuck, who rescued whom?]

Being a James Joyce fan, I was planning to call them James and Joyce

Being a happily married James Joyce fan, WE call them Leopold and Livia (Leo and Livie).

I am going to call my next pet “Peeves” so I can introduce my friends to ‘my pet peeves.’  Peeves will probably be a turtle, or a unwanted mouse…Slow, dirty, irritating, maybe even infectious (salmonella, rickettsia, ohmygodosis...you name it).  Of course, cats can be fairly peevishly self-possessed and stand-off-ish, too.  Some might consider than part of their allure.

Some of my favourite early Joyce (and first onomatopoeia of 'kiss'), is from A Portrait: "What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?"

There is a best (at least in an Anselmian sense). My goal…the beginning of my morning ‘praymeditation’ is to ‘be better for the best!’

Mom101: Today would have been my mother’s 101st birthday.  Happy birthday, Alycce!

The pandemic ended up being an ~ 3 year transition into retirement for me. The whole of 2023 will be, in many ways, the transition into retirement. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have (and could have) retired much earlier. But, working from home, it was convenient to work, AND my wonderful wife made sure I was fed, watered and following safe Covid practices. Overall, especially the last almost 2 years, although I would have preferred no pandemic and although the precautions and isolation were not insignificantly inconvenient, the pandemic period had upsides—regular (and enhanced) reading and swimming, f’r’instance.
It is interesting how some friendships seem to have paused during the pandemic and some have frayed. 

Philosophically and absolutely I non-despondently ponder if there is even the possibility of nothing?


You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Innominal Patriotism is Filling and Spiritually Sanctifying

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live


‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.’”​ — Anthony de Mello​

My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

a lot of special friends and special memories.

Now, I’m thinking 'bout eternity
Some kind of ecstasy’s
Got a hold on me...
