28 March

A day without James Joyce, who ’turned his mind to unknown arts,’ is a day without insightful creative thought. 

F'r'instance, Deshil Commodius Eamus which could, i suppose mean 'The Shield of Commonwealth Amuses.'

Our Commonwealth house (Castillo Vargo) is a very very very fine house with…two cats...
…a bonded feral Siamese rescue pair  [But, as has been previously opined and even bumper stuck, who rescued whom?]

Being a James Joyce fan, I was planning to call them James and Joyce

Being a happily married James Joyce fan, WE call them Leopold and Livia (Leo and Livie).

I am going to call my next pet “Peeves” so I can introduce my friends to ‘my pet peeves.’  Peeves will probably be a turtle, or a unwanted mouse…Slow, dirty, irritating, maybe even infectious (salmonella, rickettsia, ohmygodosis...you name it).  Of course, cats can be fairly peevishly self-possessed and stand-off-ish, too.  Some might consider than part of their allure.

Some of my favourite early Joyce (and first onomatopoeia of 'kiss'), is from A Portrait: "What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?"

There is a best (at least in an Anselmian sense). My goal…the beginning of my morning ‘praymeditation’ is to ‘be better for the best!’

Mom101: Today would have been my mother’s 101st birthday.  Happy birthday, Alycce!

The pandemic ended up being an ~ 3 year transition into retirement for me. The whole of 2023 will be, in many ways, the transition into retirement. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have (and could have) retired much earlier. But, working from home, it was convenient to work, AND my wonderful wife made sure I was fed, watered and following safe Covid practices. Overall, especially the last almost 2 years, although I would have preferred no pandemic and although the precautions and isolation were not insignificantly inconvenient, the pandemic period had upsides—regular (and enhanced) reading and swimming, f’r’instance.
It is interesting how some friendships seem to have paused during the pandemic and some have frayed. 

Philosophically and absolutely I non-despondently ponder if there is even the possibility of nothing?


You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Innominal Patriotism is Filling and Spiritually Sanctifying

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live


‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.’”​ — Anthony de Mello​

Friday 24, 2023
My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

a lot of special friends and special memories.

Now, I’m thinking 'bout eternity
Some kind of ecstasy’s
Got a hold on me...
