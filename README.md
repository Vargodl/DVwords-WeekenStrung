05 JULY

VARGOLADZ went quite well today.  Topics included discussions about Independence Day, travels (of Lex and Win over the next week) and then extensions of last weeks discussion but focussed more on the thin and blurry/grey zone between the transition of life to death.  Examples included the split second of 'forced immediate termination or ending of life' which occurs at cryogenic freezing, what probably happened in the Titan mini-sub, death by GSW (Gun Shot Wound) to the head.  Discussion included brain death and what it means, including post-anoxia recovery of cardiovascular function despite dissolved or dissolving brain function (vs in the more usual case, cardiovascular function ceases and the brain slowly (over say 4 to 10 minutes or so) as the brains looses its function).  A similar brief discussion focussed on the death of single celled organisms on a microscope slide.  There is not a clear switch point, largely unknown probably because there is not a lot of controlled attempts at reversal over time.

Whether a human organism or a single cell, the physical organism just before 'the moment of death' is no different from just after the moment of death...except that an invisible, unmeasurable vital life force is gone and when it is gone, maintenance and energy forces cease and entropy, dissolution and chaos begin.  Mitochondria stop mitochondriasizing.

The Fourth of July
INDEPENDENCE DAY...VARGOLADZ tomorrow

![image](https://github.com/Vargodl/DVwords-WeekenStrung/assets/128755897/b83177a9-05cc-4e02-819d-81a5d83fed62)

This is the special US holiday of The Fourth of July, celebrating US independence.  This is celebrated across the land with barbecues and other cook-outs and parties as well as widespread parades, events, musical performances and fireworks.


I do admit that, despites Joe Biden's optimism, I am quite concerned about this great American experiment.  Despite the truly remarkable omniscient selfishless of the strong egos of the founding fathers, there was dedication to democracy and republic--especially George Washington, who could have fairly easily become the first leader and first emperor of the new nation.  But he put ego aside for the republic.  Ego is in short supply these days and the invisible hand is much more selfish and greedier.  The two poles of America continue to separate and partisan is strangling truth, doing right and compromise.

thank you, George Washington, for being Father and not Emperor of this great country!


PS, Leo is OK.


...nonetheless, and just one more thing (which I hope is correct):

As Bill Clinton said at his 1993 inauguration:

“There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”

July 2:

Our male kitty, Leo (after Ulysses protagonist hero Leopold Bloom) has been ill all week.  It started with an upper respiratory infection treated with antibiotics which resulted in tummy upset, urinary retention and, mostly now anorexia and significant constipation.  He's uncomfortable and we are trying to work him through this.  We are on poop watch.  You can see the rolls of poop in his colon outlined appropriately in brown in the xray below:

![image](https://github.com/Vargodl/DVwords-WeekenStrung/assets/128755897/3bb7277b-9ba9-4764-860b-8ba3446dcd18)



There is an awkward demographic squeeze coming to a head:  because of the advancements in health care, our population continues to "boom" which has the potential to bankrupt social systems.  That, of course is the demand side.  The supply side is not enough younger workers to feed the social support sausage machine.  This is further compounded by the increasingly educated child bearing female slice of the population who are either (1) having fewer children or (2) chooding career and not having any children at all. This is not meant to blame, but to recognize issues.  There are no easy solutions.  From experience, having and raising children is very difficult and life changing.  But it is wonderfully life changing and very meaningful.  I would definitely do it again--at least if I could know I would have the same exceptional sons.

Jun 28: very good Vargoladz a somewhat inexact meandering through a history of society, including slavery, mostly from Greece forward though with some speculation about 'pre-social' cave clans and clusters

Jun 27: Vargoladz tomorrow; 3 months retired

The super wealthy seem to be achieving Versailles-like status. And some of them are dying in passion ego projects and searches for extremes which only they can afford. These are usually at extremes of pressure—whether in the oceans depths or in the stratosphere—or other scales such as speed or longevity.

Instead of suicide by money, it is probably more like Russian roulette at extremes.  Why not just near asphyxiation?

Most recently and obviously this is evident by the Titan disaster, which galvanized public attention and multinational state of the art rescue attempts for 5 people versus the almost ‘blink and its forgotten’ refugee tragedy in the Mediterranean where perhaps 600 desperate refugees drowned while a Greek rescue vessel essentially looked the other way and did nothing.  I’m not the first to point of the ethical issues and inconsistencies in this.

It is fair to point out that the Titan seemed to be a race against time (a surrogate for oxygen) and there were even some outlets who had an oxygen countdown on.  There is some speculation that this was for naught because they knew the sub imploded on Sunday, squeezed in a death grip along the length of the tube, probably shredding the inhabitants who had little time to know what was happening and so soon afterward we’re pressure emulsified without nervous systems to experience the last minutes of life—>death. 
Though there is some unclear evidence that they knew they were in trouble (perhaps the acrylic cap what beginning to chatter as the pilot warned…though warning that this would give them enough time to get up to safety) because they dropped their sandbags to initiate a rise. 

As for the poor refugees, they were also dead almost before they died but they had the bad luck of being ‘too many…nameless…faceless…and likely paying all the little they had' for this last chance.

There is still significant information daily about the sub…so I guess the news cycle still hopes to capitalize on some eyeballs.

Sooooooo...not too surprisingly, Titan and its inhabitants are dead.  What is a bit surprising is that the US Navy probably detected the catastrophic implosion on Sunday, information which they shared with the appropriate rescue agents.  This doesnt explain about the repetitive noises heard the last few days.

Sooooo...5 people are unnecesarily dead and many bits of information and cross-accusations about shoddy work are yet to emerge.  I do feel sorry for those who were involved in preparing the vessel for launch -- god forbid there was some human error (which is probably irrefutable).  in some ways, for several of the untrained 'mission specialists,' this is suicide by hubris or suicide by wealth.

I praise all the many involved in the desperate search and I'm glad for them and the families of those lost, that they were able to resolve this before there was going to need to be some sort of practical although somewhat arbitrary decision to wind down the search because of futility due to probable asphyxia.  It is interesting to me, however, that the finding was around the time of running out of breathable air.

I'm not an expert or naval engineer but to me, the most likely scenario is that the vessel imploded on its descent to Titanic--probably not too far above the wreck, and split into two parts/debris fields.  It seems unlikely to me that any significant human remains will be retrieved because, unlike the heavy metal debris, the remains were probably significantly shredded and floated away on the internal streams around the seabed, now to be devoured by deep sea sea worms and other denizens.

Based on my understanding of the design of the minisub, I think either the glass domed cap fractured or, more likely, the long sides of the capsule crushed and popped off the nose cone like a tube of toothpaste.  I'm not sure death was instantenous (like 'turning off a switch') but it was probably mercifully quick.  

Remember this was at a very significant depth with tremendous pressures which crushed (imploded) the sub. It did not EXplode but IMplode.  This is the submariners concept of 'crush depth,' which is an appropriately descriptive term. This is unlike what happens in airplanes or spaceships in which case the pressure inside rhe tube is approximately atmospheric and the outside pressure is lower (threrfore, explosions outward are possible and 'easy.'  In the case of submarines there are tremendous external pressures on a more or less atmospheric interior.  


I may not be expert here, but I am not ignorant either.  I have had a long history of interest in submarines--which began way before I enlisted in the US Navy--which I joined to be in the nuclear submarine service.  This was initially stimulated by my dad's pleasant reminiscences of his navy time and significantly stimulated when I met my cousin's cousin, who was in the nuclear sub service. based in Holy Loch Scotland.  In my navy career, I spent a week on a nuke 1/4 of a mile under the sea probably going more than 30 knots during my second year summer rotations.

The modern nuclear navy is a tremendous service.  The original WWII era submarines were essentially ships that could go underwater for a relatively short period of time under battery power (kind of like hybrids today--primarily powered by diesel engines, including to generate the electricity to charge the many batteries).  My dad, who was also in the navy in WWII, mentioned that you could always identify the submariners because they always smelled like deisel fuel.). They were even 'ship shaped' (and, of course, shipshape) with V or wedge shaped hulls which are not good designs to minimize the effects of pressure on crushing or implosion.  

Modern subs also have a significant presence in southeastern Connecticut, where I lived when I worked for Pfizer. State of the art submarines are still being built across the Thames River at Electric Boat, in Groton and one of our sub bases are just a bit further upriver.  When I worked at Pfizer, we would regularly see subs going up and down the river going out to or coming in from sea.  Although I wasnt in New London on 9-11, I have been told that multiple subs scrambled out to sea on that day, in case an attack on the base took place.  Further, many retired sub captains live around us.  Had I not left the navy to go to med school, I very well might be one of those retired sub captains today.


Nuclear propulsion changed a great deal.  These subs are teardrop or bullet shaped which evenly distribute external pressure making them able to go much deeper.  In fact, modern subs are much more stable at depth than on the surface.  AND, because of the nuclear propulsion, they can stay submerged and under power for significant periods of time.  This is why there are now two types of subs: fast-attack and boomers (essentially mobile nuclear missile platforms wrapped within a submarine).  Fast attack subs go on patrol to fight; boomers stealthily go out to remote undetected locations and wait (usually 4-6 months at a time) as a deterrent response.  This is the real 'silent service.' 


For the submariner, there are two types of ships: submarines and targets.






Sea-Fever BY JOHN MASEFIELD

I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,

And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;

And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking,

And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.

 
I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide

Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;

And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,

And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.

 
I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,

To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;

And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,

And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.



...but just one more thing:

…I, too, continue to hear the Sirens call me to the sea…and to hope that my eventual death, still a lifetime from now, is in its rocking calming sedative rhythmic waving arms—a baptismal transportation to the long beyond.  Returning and untombing my body into seawater and sending my spirit into space and sky--the crashing waves my mourning song, the moon my monument.

50th anniversary of my uncle Albert's industrial electrocution death

just recently back from a wonderful week in Paris (more on transporting this moveable feast to Boston) where I enjoyed a fantastic Bloomsday at Shakespeare & Co.  And of course, there was this enigmatic woman at the Louvre:

![image](https://github.com/Vargodl/DVwords-WeekenStrung/assets/128755897/77a181aa-9a89-47ff-be16-a0e66289acb6)



But...a quick prediction before tomorrow:  The 'party, ego-project' minisub is probably stuck somewhere in the Titanic debris field.  The inhabitants--at least three of which were rich, ego-centric, high-ticket-paying joy riders--will not be found n time (and will only be found in any reasonable time around the Titanic) to be saved. I dont think there was a catastrophic event (implosion or fire) which was an early termination event.
This is, however, an example of the consequences of a series of overweaning hubridites.  Titan, an oxymoronically poorly named and designed pleasure minisub primarily for the rich to hire to go to the sacred watery graveyard of the 'unsinkable' Titanic...is like a thumb in the eye of the gods AND GUESS WHAT?: Titanic 0, Titan 0, gods 2!  And remember: Titan was killed by the 110+ year old, rust bucket of the Titanic....and likely at least 3 people died because they had too much money and they thought they'd do the near impossible (if not the ego-fueled ridiculous).

Oxymandias!  How the might are fallen!

A few thoughts (by myself and others) about knowledge and inquiry:


“The highest levels of consciousness are wordless.”  Charles Simic 

Baggini: 
It is easy to slide from the justified belief that nothing can he known for certain to the deeply sceptical conclusion that nothing is really known at all. Some find this thrilling. But it is also toxic since it leaves us with no reason to believe anything and so no basis upon which to act.
Fortunately, there is a fatal flaw in the sceptical challenge: it makes an unreasonable demand and then complains that it can't be met. If knowledge has to be 'beyond all doubt, nothing could ever pass the test. However unlikely it is, you can't rule out that the world is a hallucination, a simulation, a dream.

John Searle: I don’t take skepticism seriously. 

'Tir gan teanga, tir gan anam': a land without a language is a land without a soul. (Irish saying)

Paraphrasing Maureen MoGovern, 'Never use someone else’s impairment as a metaphor for your ignorance.'

I was Screaming through emails yesterday—finding so many similar lists of life advice and life lessons…a bit redundant actually

Did the Bible actually start on universal Day 3 or 4 with “let there be light?”  So an early bible day could actually be billions of earth years?

Genesis 1

The Beginning

1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.


Each person’s 'now 'is different, unique, individualized.

How much more complicated youth sexploration must be these days. No longer just “can I do it, should I do it” (naturally tempered for some by same sex leanings but still usually inclined by implicit expectation toward opposite sex), but now “is gender important to my explorations?” 
Before it was focused on characteristics of individuals in a different, inexplicable (gender) group: beauty, tits, ass, male pussytropism, etc; now individual characteristics with less gender specific characterization, classification — liking the same things in others you like in yourself.  Do opposites attract?  How opposite do opposites have to be to attract?


Things we only do with our “ones-and-onlies" some of which we then do with the next, although with some different configurations.

The first version is often the worst—in part because follow ups tease out the weaknesses of the first version and improve upon them. Like life, we get better from our tries and errors. 

How lucky I am to be able to share time together with Margie, begin with our pleasant sharing of the morning over coffee and tea—I wish the same for others…in fact, I encourage everyone to prioritize it. 

I am luckier, I think than others are—at least than they are aware for them or me. That is probably just an optimistic attitude but, instead of -destructive, it is self-fulfilling. 

My dad embodied and instilled many good attitudes. One was a smiling sincere through-the-bone-marrow optimism. In addition, he always  focused on family, hard work, learning, questioning and education, especially higher education. He believed in the goodness of people and the value of self-improvement and always getting better,

There are many ways we self-harm, sabotage, destruct, detract. How much longer healthier better if we didn’t. We are own worst telomere shorteners. 

I wonder what would life be like…and how long would it be without self-sabotage and natural external damages and disasters.

Every unhappiness is unique.

Tomorrow is the beginning of Pride Month...and I fear that pride is under increasing attack.  I am completely supportive, though I did need to become more aware before I was.  I do wonder if things went too far too fast and therefore the extent of the back

Notice, that there is a duo, awkwardly named perhaps, who, among many others, will be celebrating pride:

ClitSplash was founded in 2020 by two writers—one Italian and one Cuban—and came from the idea that the Web3 space was basically 90 percent cisgender male, and this created an echo chamber effect. ClitSplash stands for sexual liberation, equal representation, and diverse perspectives on human sexuality to showcase digital art by women, queer, trans, and other sex-positive groups to create a new, authentic narrative in the digital space.

May 24  Vargoladz this evening

First post Covid respiratory infection. With all the previous precautionary protection, we’ve almost forgotten how to become or be ill. Testing negative, “It’s not Covid” is a false flag of careless courage.

Like Paul at the gym, “I’m not feeling well but I tested and it’s not Covid” apparently makes it excusable to bring your other infectious messes with you wherever you go...including the gym and other public places.

Margie now also has my cold and we realize we should have acted as if and worn masks to protect each other (really me protect her).   Lessons only partially learnt. Seems like we’ve forgotten that we are not virgins to infection so we erroneously think it is ok if we practice unsafely. Interesting that!

I REFUSE to get covid but how did i catch an URI?

I finished The Paris Bookseller yesterday--surprised to learn that the current Shakespeare and Company is not the original, legacy Shakespeare and Company that Sylvia Beach opened in 1919.  She closed that due to WWII in 1941 and George Whitman (unclear if he was related to Walt, who was a big piece of Slyvia's store) opened what was originally called La Mistral in 1951 (another American bookstore in Paris) at a different location where it currently still is.  Sylvia Beach visited Whitman's store and is said to have called it the "spiritual successor" to hers.  He renamed it Shakespeare and Company in 1964, Shakespeare's 400th birthday, to honor the original...and named his daughter Sylvia--possibly even Sylvia Beach Whitman. The shop's motto, "Be Not Be Inhospitable to Strangers Lest They Be Angels in Disguise", is written above the entrance to the reading library. George, who seems quite a literary traveller, died at the ripe age of 98 in 2011.  His daughter Sylvia now runs it.

Whitman's shop opened just two years before his friend Lawrence Ferlinghetti co-founded City Lights in San Francisco (which Margie and I visited when we lived in San Francisco before Ferlinghetti died (aged 101)). 

I've been to Shakeseare and Company several times--it is one of my 'must-stops' on each trip to Paris.  I have also purchased things from them, including rare books and, last year, a newly printed edition of Ulysses which they put out for its 100th anniversary.  

“Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.”
Excerpt From Ulysses James Joyce

About 3 years ago, I also purchased the book which the bookstore published of its own history (Shakespeare and Company, Paris: A History of the Rag & Bone Shop of the Heart, 2016).  I'll plan to peruse that before our visit.

i started reading Nabokov's Despair today  Will (re-)read Hemingway's Mobile Feet before our upcoming trip as well.

History is a conversation and sometimes a shouting match between present and past, though often the voices we most want to hear are barely audible.  - Laurel Thatcher Ulrich

“There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when they are shown, those who do not see,” -- Leonardo da Vinci.


A lifespan is a short ongoing span of now, dragging a short tail of a past, of indeterminant length with the individual possessing it never knowing that it ends, how it ends, when it ends.  Consciousness probably ends before the consciousness of the end (which never comes because the consciousness ended first). For the person/experiencing, her/s ‘now’ stops in medias res.

Life is like a vine of cherry tomatoes, each with seeds which, like the meanings and significances of life, are difficult to pin down.  When you think you are about to ‘pin down’ a meaning, like a tomato seed, it squirts away.

At the other extreme of the universal timeline (a la Tonelli):

Roughly 1 trillion years from now, the last star will be born. In about 100 trillion years, the last light will go out. The bad news is that the universe is going to die a slow, aching, miserable death. The good news is that we won't be around to see it.

May 18:

Time is our only possession (my high school senior thesis) and yet it is a slippery bugger of unclear and inconsistent (some would say individual) dimensions.  On one hand, we live in the enternal now as everything is always happening NOW, yet there is a past and we depend on an as yet unseen future.

NOW is like a mathematical point on a line with perhaps one or more likely zero dimensions.  Unlike lines, which are 2-dimensional strings of points, or spaces, which are 3-dimensional, you cannot measure a point.  In some ways, it is just a connection of what is left of it with what is right of it.  Similarly NOW is the connection from past to future.  It is 'instantaneous' but without measure.  NOW is the funnel or filter from which the future converts to the past...suggesting an apt analogy of an 'hour glass.'

I think that most people live in the now but forward looking (into the future to direct their paths).  I have found that, as I'd hoped and intended, in retirement, I am living in the now but directionally planning for the future but also (as I'd hoped for many years) reviewing past thoughts and experienced in the greater depth because of the lack of daily external urgencies, distractions and responsibilities of employed life.   So, though I've always been reflective, my mirrors are shinier, more prismatic and in much better focus now.  

So I wonder, as some have postulated, was there a time before time?  Supposedly the 'big bang' occurred in about 10^-45 seconds--an infinitesimally miniscule time which  possibly was the beginning of time.  How does that really make sense?

And, as Einstein supposedly quipped concerning the relativity of time: "How long a minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you are on."

One recent yet major exception to the infinitesimal now that we’ve all recently experienced is the Covid pandemic a worrisome possibly fatal 3 year “now!”

NOW is like the interface between oil and water. Nothing actually exists there in the separation, just the two opposing non mixing fluids, like NOW is the immeasurable interface between future and past, tomorrow and yesterday…even a microsecond before and a microsecond second past. 

Yet, colloquially (and tautologically), tomorrow is just another day. 

Eventually, the next day after the next day after next day after the next day becomes…tomorrow.

Lost time is never found again.

“There are kind people in the world.”   (See  "…and just one more thing:" below)

In general, the default position is to love your mother and idealize her as the paragon of beauty, virtue and dedication. Not all mothers come near that of course…few if any actually do...though we need to believe it is so.
Grandmothers deserve more love and respect in general, especially if their daughters become good mothers (not grand but good). 
About 45 years ago I had the privilege of knowing Marie Miller, Mike’s (ACP colleague’s) French wife.  It was around Mother’s Day and she was talking about grandmothers (grandmere in French) but she translated the French word grandmere literally as ‘great mother,” and although it isn’t the correct translation, it is wonderfully descriptive for who a grandmother is and what a grandmother does.  

Grandparents Day is in September.  I think we should have a Great Mothers Day for our grandmothers—-perhaps, like orthodox Easter, the next Sunday after Mothers Day.

I just found out today that this is Masturbation May.  Congratulate yourself!  Give yourself a hand.

A new book has snuck in to my reading—The Night of Many Endings. It, and Tonelli’s Genesis are driving my reading this week.  Tonelli because it is so informative (on the cosmos) and somewhere between erudite and obscurely though multifacetedly referential and sometimes esoteric. TNoME because it is quite interestingly descriptively written about the true humanity in down-and-out or lost people (Flannery O'Connor's 'grotesques?').  I should be done with both books soon.

Another example of Tonelli:  The hypothesis that the universe contains great quantities of non-luminous matter was first advanced in 1933 by Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss astrophysicist possessed of great ingenuity and a mischievous sense of humour. It's said that when other scientists voiced any scepticism concerning his theories, he would insult chem by calling them 'spherical bastards'. (Bastards from any angle)

I also recently bought the book How To Think Like a Philosopher as I seem to be  ‘right-shifting’ to philosophy and cosmology (the first step toward philosophical scientific speculation, e.,g., cosmology as ‘natural philosophy’.)

Only in silence can you hear the music of the spheres;
The “sounds of silence” a cosmic hum.

In the sauna at the JCC today, I had a repeat pleasant interaction with a guy in the way slow kindnesses and friendships evolve. As I was exiting, I wanted to leave him with a positive and uplifting thought so I said, “Love someone a bit more today than you do now;  I hope they sense that and so do you.”  [actually, given editorial time, this is much better than what I said but it had the same sense.]. He thanked me and wished the same to me.

A few minutes later, another pool mate pointed out that someone had rescued his old but worthwhile (to him) soap container.  He said to me, “There are kind people in the world.”  So I take it that my first message worked…and I thank the cosmos for that spherical music.

Kindness, goodness and gratitude radiate to others, then splash back to you and also slosh on to others around you.

Although there may be no measurable long term benefit to kindness, gratitude and gentleness…even the short term burst of well being is worth the feel good effect.

Mother's Day history. A West Virginia woman named Anna Jarvis created the day in 1908 to honor her own mother who had passed 3 years earlier. By 1910, it was a West Virginia holiday, and then a national one in 1914. The twist? Anna Jarvis spent her later years campaigning against Mother's Day. She felt it had become too commercial.

Tomorrow is Mothers Day.  From my point of view (not sure if it is appropriate to call it a ‘vantage point’), the role of mother is probably the most unique role there is, especially for human mothers.  

Few men would want the inconvenience of bearing children for 9 months; the male machinery (embarrassingly boggy in the baggies) is for ‘shooting and leaving,’

We were recently informed that someone close to us (let’s call him ‘BeJesus’) was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.  He is not likely to do anything about it because he has an ‘ancient’ irrational fear of hospitals, likely because about 50 years ago his father, of similar fear and probably the originator of this fear, got sick, was hospitalized…and died.  
Oddly inconsistent with BeJesus’s fear, about 20 years ago, after a life of too many cigarettes and alcohol, he was struggling at home in increasing congestive heart failure, then again not going to the hospital because he ‘knew’ he was dying. His wife got him to the hospital then…and that bought him these last 20 years though obviously didn’t change his hospitalophobia.  This time, due to unbiopsied spots on his lungs, he again is unable/unwilling to take definitive actions and just let himself go…hospice has been contacted.

I remember my dad telling me about the hospitals of old…overcrowded places full of death, the smell of piss and the moans of constant pain.   Indeed in those days, going to the hospital was closely associated with hopelessness, fear, uncontrolled pain and death.  AND, even up until recently, chemotherapy was horrible with many awful side effects. BUT these are no longer those days!  Hospitals are hospitable, diseases are fairly easily treated, pain is well controlled.

In addition, though I admit that medical care (especially innovative pharmaceutical oncology treatments) are frequently very expensive, we have made excellent progress in the treatment of many cancers—chief among them lung cancer (which I agree he probably does have).  There are many targeted, very tolerable and highly effective treatments. People with Stage 4 cancer are living for good years with these treatments. And, health insurance, including the Medicare that BeJesus most certainly has, provides much support for diagnosis and treatment. 

So it is a terrible shame that BeJesus is giving up and withdrawing, possibly robbing himself and his family of at least several more good life-years.  Unfortunate that for lack of exploring, a person who has meant much to many will likely very prematurely shuck his mortal coil…going softly into that good night. We will never know.

One of the other tragedies of BeJesus’s story is that he has been estranged from one of his sons, his namesake. I’m not sure what (or what series of things) happened exactly but I think it was probably caused by their genetic nature-cum-nurture of bullheadedness, likely facilitated  by generous lubrications of alcohol.  I’ve been told that Big BeJesus doesn’t want to have anything to do with Little BeJesus (BeJesus fils) so another tragedy is that they will never reconcile which means that younger BeJesus will spend the rest of his life unable to reconcile, resolve or come to grips with this schism.  Young BeJesus will never be able to have the BeJesus the third know his grand father.

Mass Shooting numbness: (I am very sad to be coming to the  realization that a numbness is actually setting in…that the number of shootings is so overwhelming that they are no longer surpirsing or resulting in mind lasering horror and distraction.  In addition, some of the shootings seem to have meaningless, 'practico interté' (because I can) rationales).  This is truly the next meta-tragedy of the mass of mass shootings.

The only real reason we care about Jamie Foxx’s health is the curiosity of what we don’t know which is what keeps getting cryptically announced, catputing the imagination and curiousity. 

We are frequently confronted with options and choises.  (A recurrent commercial suggests that it is up to 50,000 a day.) Many choices are provided and prompted as binary.  BUT IT IS IMPORTANT to remember that, except in emergencies, there is at least one more option—and it is often the best option: “Let me think about it.”

Concerning the Chuck coronation, he was anointed in private with holy oils by the Arch of Can’tbury (The Cadbury).

It’s been 70 years between coronations in
the dwindling luxury brand of the British empire —probably most effective for monetizing merchandise and people.  Although I thought Brexit was the wrong, Putin-influenced decision, I hope this is the last coronation for a much smaller United (only/sort of) Kingdom because it seems a self-indulgent money, prestige and power grab by the ‘firm’ of a racist family that don’t actually have any power.   
The coronation of ‘the king’ yesterday cost (mostly the British taxpayers)  around 100 million pounds—and that was supposedly downsized. Half the population watched—the other half on the food lines. Other than the British populace there, most of the paying attendees seemed to have been visiting dignitaries, press (including people from Boston TV channels…and widely smiling Lionel Ritchie. 
Harry, in self-imposed exile, was there to represent the most obviously self-absorbed and self-promoting appendix of the royally confused family.

Word meanings…

I like, appreciate, laud and am awed by the power of words, soft words, power words, words slanting leftwards/rightwards, words cursive (Fuck) and shocking (rape). I’m not especially interested in offense (cunt) but rather surprise (zouch).
Words that ‘can’t be said’ (though I’m not exactly sure why they can’t (by some, not all at least)) no matter the context. 

Clearly it is not the word, not the series of letters, nay the sounds but rather the meaning and (even more than meaning), the connotation.  Even oblique references to the offensive word can be offensive (the best example I can think of is “See (C) you (U) Next Tuesday,” which I recently heard Stephen Colbert say when referring to Tucker Carlson’s ‘Troubles’).
This is one of the reasons that words can be either powerful, incomprehensible or bland in foreign languages… and why we try to learn the dirty words in the languages we are studying. 

For words to be offensive, of course, there has to be someone(s) who are offended…increasingly powerful by how many someones are in the group and how 'important/influential' they are, how legitimately aggrieved it is, how unified, how aware the offenders are and especially if they are indifferent or even hostile to the group, how vocal and how long they’ve been aggrieved (among other criteria).

Words are beautiful. Like David Hume’s statement about beauty:  “Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.”
In this case “offensiveness/danger’ is no quality in words themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different offensiveness.”

So it is important to appreciate the meaning and power of words but not be cowed by them. To know how to use words yet not run from them. 

Two pertinent Nietzsche quotes:

Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are. 

The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.

Words can be powerful, impactful, shocking even mean...but they aren't sticks and stones...they can't hurt you.  They can be loaded but they dont pierce flesh.  The biggest risks are emotional injury or perhaps incitement to violence.  But to let words incite violent behaviour is a choice or at least lack of control.

Jean Carrol, in her trial against D Trump, accuses him of raping her.  She does not avoid that word, she maybe the victim but she is denying victimhood.


I've really enjoyed the following letter about words.  like the author, I modified it and used it as a cover letter and it indeed got me in the door:

“Dear Sir:
I like words. I like fat buttery words, such as ooze, turpitude, glutinous, toady. I like solemn, angular, creaky words, such as straitlaced, cantankerous, pecunious, valedictory. I like spurious, black-is-white words, such as mortician, liquidate, tonsorial, demi-monde. I like suave “V” words, such as Svengali, svelte, bravura, verve. I like crunchy, brittle, crackly words, such as splinter, grapple, jostle, crusty.
I like sullen, crabbed, scowling words, such as skulk, glower, scabby, churl. I like Oh-Heavens, my-gracious, land’s-sake words, such as tricksy, tucker, genteel, horrid. I like elegant, flowery words, such as estivate, peregrinate, elysium, halcyon. I like wormy, squirmy, mealy words, such as crawl, blubber, squeal, drip. I like sniggly, chuckling words, such as cowlick, gurgle, bubble and burp.
I like the word screenwriter better than copywriter, so I decided to quit my job in a New York advertising agency and try my luck in Hollywood, but before taking the plunge I went to Europe for a year of study, contemplation and horsing around.
I have just returned and I still like words.
May I have a few with you?
Robert Pirosh”

but we really discussed semantics, especially the word RAPE.  The younger others affirmed that the R word shouldn't be used, but should rather be referred to as 'sexual assault.'  I never heard of such a ban and, from a transitive or logical perspective, I would suggest that they don't refer to identical things.  In other words, rape is a sexual assault but sexual assault isn't necesarrily rape.  Sexual assault is a much broader, basket term.  I agree the word 'rape' is a powerful, jarring term--and it should be because it is a horrific, violent act.


Though it shouldn't need to be stated or restated, I think sexual including rape are horrible violations.  I am confident that I never did and I never will commit or condone such acts.

The Opportune Gift of Friendship

‘Life’ is a banquet, fecund, perhaps even fractal, in its many opportunities and riches.  Some of the greatest riches are the natural inclinations for connecting, bonding and collaborating which occur between most living beings—inter and intra-species.  These are filigreed in us humans in our reciprocal interactions and relationship with pals and partners…friends and lovers, and we as individuals.

Our friends shine spotlights on the many opportunities life offers so that we can better see, share, enjoy and appreciate them.  These relationships are chapters of our personal life books that stretch and expand us beyond our innate individual limitation in space, thought and time and outside of ourselves—expanding our intellects, our reaches and our limited spans. We travel further when we travel with our companions of books…and others.  

“Best friends” (really ‘better’ friends, because most of us are fortunate enough to have several in the course of our lives) are the real magic of connectedness. These are the friends with whom we can resume the relation despite years of disconnection or separation, kind of like a discussion interrupted by being separated into different elevator cars which resumes as soon as the elevator doors open, the riders reconnect and the conversation resumes, barely missing a phrase. In this analogy, the elevator, like the friendship,  lifts us up taking us higher to where we want to go.  (And sometimes, we just ride for the joy of being with a friend.)

Today a group of us shared a surprise brunch celebration for a friend’s (FV) next employment chapter as he starts a new job tomorrow.  We surprised him with our love and support in this worthwhile venture.  He knows we are there for him and share his excitement.

Similarly, I resumed an ‘elevator-interrupted’ conversation with a special friend (RN) this evening.

So, here’s to friends…the flowers in our gardens…our sparks of joy. 

Thank you for being a friend

An interesting day--have been on line most of the day with the Andrew Weill Center on Alternative Medicine, which has been very interesting so far.  Including with the interesting presenter with massive sunglasses due to the headaches of traumatic brain injury talking about medical creative poetry (without rules).  Interesting that her somewhat bizarre appearance does cause one (me) to 'wonder if she is all there.'  Sad, probably unfair, but true.  Similar to the topic of mental illness mentioned yesterday.  

I began my post-Med School training in Psychiatry at the University of Chicago (a very biological (medically oriented) approach.  It was even then a speciality looking for rigor.  The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) which was the basis of diagnosis was like  a chinese menu-->  if your patient has 3 of the 5 main symptoms from column A, 3 of the 7 from column B and is less than 65 years old...the diagnosis is xxx.  And even then, symptoms are prone to interpretation and therefore inexact.  Further the DSM kept amending, revising and changing.  I don't even thingk homosexuality is a disease any more...Imagine that???  Although the diagnostic tools do get better, it is still largely a matter of interpreting actions and words.  So it is not too much a stretch to imagine that psychiatry could be an instrument to control those who they who are in power want or need to control.  I'm not suggesting that this is and has been the only purpose or use for psychiatry...I don't believe it is.

As mentioned yesterday, psychiatry and asylums were used to control 'wayward,' independent wives and women.  (Some simply because they enjoyed masturbation too much (not sure how much that is) and some because ... believe it or not ... they did not want to have sex with their husbands.)  I suppose if divorce weren't so frowned upon at the time (including for women who often probably had no means of support after divorce), the institutionalization of women would have been less.

“When I was in the asylum they locked me up..but what did I care for that as long as they had no key that would fit my mouth?”
Phebe B Davis, 1855


I learned a few interesting bits today:
1)  The word  Eskimo has a racist history and most people in Canada and Greenland still prefer other terms. The most widespread is Inuit, which means simply, "people." The singular, which means "person," is Inuk.
2)  One of my favorite meals, pasta puttanesca, may have been named because puttanesca is the adjectival term for 'whore' or 'prostitute'  and it may have been invented in one of many bordellos in Naples working-class neighbourhoods as a quick meal taken between servicing clients. Alternatively, according to food historian Jeremy Parzen: "Italians use puttana (and related words) almost the way we use shit, as an all-purpose profanity, so pasta alla puttanesca might have originated with someone saying, essentially, 'I just threw a bunch of shit from the cupboard into a pan'.

Try as we might, men are probably at best myopic feminists, or myopic anti-chauvinists.  Many of us are sensitized to the equality of women but, like someone else's pain, you can try to be aware of it but it probably doesn't always intrude (painfully) into your very being.

I finished my Margie's LasSupprise tableau today (to thank those who were able to attend our event in NYC on April 1st):

…just one more thing…

The emanations of ‘new history’ (events, especially significant ones, that will move the needle and measure in history) are significantly colored by the eyes of the victors and the powerful (who record and propagate them as fact, and myth). This is also true for past history—tales were writ by the strongest and most successful brutes (hopefully to be teased out and contextualized by able interested investigators later).

In a future of online records, all will be their own historians—-for 15 minutes; All will be ‘internet significant.’ AI may end up being the recognizers and appreciators of the ‘internet significant.’

 
 
 Thanks for reading today.

Re: retirement, rather than taking 'another bite at the apple,' why not take a bite at a whole sweet new fruit (low-hanging? Cherry?) and gobble that up?

There are two types of people.  Those who believe there are two types of people…

About the “is this all there is?” of the universe.  If the universe were a balloon, or a magnetic loop, it still doesn’t explain if that is all there is.

In my first class in semantics in high school, where I learned what semantics was, I was very impressed by the statement “He (because it was the editorial HE then) who can define is master!”  That is a very powerful statement that has stayed with me ever since.  I still appreciate it and agree with it but I think it is or should also be nuanced to include that masters also define—including by brute force, propaganda, advertising and manipulation.  …And, money is increasingly becoming a surrogate for mastery/leadership…whether in business, politics and elsewhere.  This is increasingly being splintered by the emergence of major news networks and outlets which create then standardize and reverberate, propogating chosen messages.
He who can define is master!  He who is master defines!

Elements of this are being clearly developed in one of the two books I am reading which were gifts from our recent Canadienne visitors. The Woman They Could not Silence by Kate Mooret is about an apparently intelligent, open-minded woman around 1860 whose increasing open-mindedness clashed with the dogma of her husband, a pastor who had a lot to lose if his wife intelligently and effectively challenged and questioned the religion he was leading--especially if he wasnt smart enough to effectively challenge her back or be seen to 'be able to control' her.  He was able to get her committed to a horrible asylum for ‘trumped up’ reasons that were used by many men to control the women in their lives. The nascent, voodoo psychiatric system was aligned with this. [NOTE: I started my post Med school training in psychiatry and I am a solid supporter of the specialty so I am not dissing psychiatry as if I was a Scientologist.  Psychiatry then was mostly an unscientific tool of the establishment. It is still not perfect but it is a valuable specialty in many parts of the world. Though I’m not so sure about places like Russia.]. At the time in the book, a wife could essentially be institutionalized because her husband wanted that.  The other ever more egregious example is the catch-22 ‘disease’ of ‘drapetomania,’ which I am ashamed to admit that I had never heard of before.  Drapetomania is (wiki) "a bit of racist, pre-Freudian quack psychology. This unusual psychological condition was only observed in black slaves during the early 1800s. Symptoms of drapetomania include a refusal to accept one's Biblically-ordained position as a sort of human livestock and the tendency to head northward at high speed in the middle of the night. The cure, unsurprisingly, was to rough up any slaves that show symptoms until symptoms disappear."  Basically, oppressors determine that if the oppressed don’t want to be oppressed, they are mentally ill and need PT ('physical' therapy).  What can be more power-mad and self-serving than that?

Rule of Thumb	-originated as a law by Sir Francis Buller in 1886 saying that a man could beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb.

History teaches us so much but it doesn’t really help us to understand the adaptive conditions and states of mind that didn’t drive people to want more or better. Why/how people tolerated so much, inured to what were probably considered the random godless whims of earlier fated times…is hard to understand…yet it still happens in some ways today.  This is probably true for most of us in ways we won't understand until our general lot is further advanced as progress marches.  For example, most of us middle aged and older probably grew up in some ways accepting that some kind of irrational 'hysteria' (not really the correct term but meaningful because psychological hysteria in women was thought to be due to the 'wondering uterus' (and hyter- is the same root in both circumstances)) was associated with pre-/peri-menstrual behavior which might be considered irrational or similar.  I think this was a folie a deux for both males and females.  Similarly, people who are truly mentally ill and act abnormally and their families/caregivers do not benefit from everyone acting as if nothing is wrong.  Families with ill, dysfunctional members are frequently dysfunctional families--in part at least because of consequent familial maladaptive behavior.

April 26, the last day of the first month of my retirement.


Retirement so far has begun much better and easier than I expected.  Margie and I are solidifying a pleasant, intimate start over coffee (which she usually makes for me) and tea  (which I usually make for her), sitting together, chatting, watching a bit of news and weather.  She usually interrupts when Roobie, our red male carnival, hears her voice and flutters down to the window, grill, cart or top of the porch umbrella.  They resume their increasingly tender Pavlovian tete-a-tete when she brings out a little cup of food and talks tenderly, almost maternally, to him (and now also his mate, Brunella, who he sometimes mouth feeds)—protecting his food by staying nearer than any of the other animals are comfortable (chipmunks Chips and Salsa;squirrels Whiteye Bulger, Bullseye, Rocky or Upton; the growing unknown rabbit family; the other birds (juncos, wrens, finches, woodpeckers, grackles and the big, loud blue jays) as well as the occasional turkeys.

I have not missed work, to my surprise and I spend much less time in email, which is a great timesaver.

I’ve been very regularly and increasingly reading (finished Stoker’s Dracula today, which I finally read for the first time.  Ive been reading multiple books at once and finished 3 books so far this week—all worth reading.  I continually read a bit of (and about) James Joyce’s Ulysses among others. Somewhere to be placed on the list are Frankenstein and The Man of La Mancha, both of which I’d begun reading within the last few years but didn’t get very far in either.  I hope that my life’s span exceeds completing one book per week of the many, many books I have/want to read.  That would guarantee a long, conscious, informed and interesting life.  Here’s a brief shoutout to our recent ‘northern Liverpudlian’ visitors—part of a lobe of our extended eccentric family, for their kind and stimulating visit…and especially the ‘brain fire starter’ books they gifted us (which I am reading two at this time AMONG the others I am reading).

I’ve been  swimming about 1/2 hour almost every day (at least 5 times a week).  Like many, I’m an ‘upper body’ swimmer and am seeing the increased definition in my upper torso and the increased strength and endurance in my stroke. A Swmp3 makes the swims more interesting and, though I’ve probably had at least 6–some air and some bone-conduction, none have been perfect and durable and none maintains consistent sound quality, usually due to movement or intra-auricular water (in the ear canal).

I’ve begun working in my studio and painting, but I am not nearly where I want to be with that at this time—something I am slowly working toward though (plan to see a future entry about “OffTh Canvas” in the next few months, with an anticipated first opening of my wonderful studio.

Life continues to be and has been an opportunity to appreciate the wonder, majesty and awareness of luck all around me…and I am very grateful.  Part of my gym practice includes a gratitude meditation in the steam room and sauna, a kind of ejaculatory (as in Catholic prayerful recitation) identification, enumeration and appreciation of the many people and things in my life for which there are far more than I have more than I have the right to have.  Chief among these are the three most important people in my life—Margie and my two sons Alex and Winston.  I’ve been becoming more specific and grateful for what I am calling ‘the eccentric circles of extended family’ (eccentric USUALLY in the sense of not concentric).  I won’t enumerate them now as I am thinking of incorporating them in a near future painting...though I had introduced the concept above.

As someone wrote:  “If I were any better, I’d have to be twins!”

In the past month, we have had a few events.  The one I am most pleased with was the surprise appreciation for Margie in NYC on April 1st at Emilio’s Balloto, thanks to Win’s help.  There was also a surprise for me on retirement day and several trips into the citIes of Boston/Cambridge, including one to our Galleries d’Orsay on Saturday for a Bruno Zupan reception.  

Shefali Agarwal visited us today and it seems likely we will likely go to Paris sometime this summer if we can arrange appropriate house sitting.

An author I’ve been reading revealed that his date of birth is the same of mine, interestingly in a passage about not believing in astrology but feeling more connected to someone of his interest when he learns they are of the same astral sign. He (the author) and I also, of course, have the same astral sign but that means little to me. Contrary to his view, having the same date of birth, is (to me) really an invisible lineation between us.  

I like to read interesting turns of phrases including seeming contradictions like “in praise of blame” and “ to live in a place without boundlessness.”  I like the end of statements to surprise and jar me by their non sequitur unexpectedness, out of place-ness, and counter-intuitivity… though not like a slap in the face or a plunge in an unexpectedly ice cold lake but more like my name whispered breathily and barely heard when no one is around or a subtle slight breath gust across but behind your ear in 3/4 pose.

April 25

A few disconnected thought provocatives, most by me, some by others:

Derek Sivers: We’re not actually bound to social norms. We don’t need permission. We don’t need to please everyone.

Yesterday was the Red Wedding episode for cable news hosts, Don Lemon and Tucker Carlson. Both were fired from their major news networks. 

The universe is larger today than it was yesterday, though probably less dense on a 'particles'/(cubic light-year) basis.
The same should be true tomorrow and many tomorrows yet to come.

Similar to the confusing qualities and parameters of the most probable God (including the mundane but curious contradition: is God so powerful that s/he can make something s/he can't lift?  More on this in a later day), the universe holds many many mysteries, the most basic being "is that all there is?" This doesn't seem to be the case because the universe is still growing.  But what (space) is the universe growing into?  If it is larger today than yesterday, where was that additional extra-yesterday's-universe space yesterday?  What is outside of the universe? how can it not be infinite? how CAN it be infinite?  Curved space doesnt account for this comfortably for me.
On the other handa-barberra, as they did make bugs bunny say: "that's all, folks!"

Into everyone’s life a little rain must fall but when it’s your drizzle, it seems gale-force and prolonged. 
There can be thunderstorms of the spirit, maelstroms of the soul. 

Books are rocketships to places, ideas and dreamscapes (inner and outer, far and wide, past, present and future). 
Words are the wings on which we fly. I am greatly enjoying collecting and recording the words we ride. 

When you begin to unconsciously (or worse) think you are more important than your message, you have begun to be dangerous.

There is nothing wrong and everything right with enjoying non-zero sum (NZS) life.

Rather than throwing everything out and starting afresh (which is difficultly impossible anyway), better to take stock and see what is workable enough to retain..at least for the being time. 

Who owns the future?

VARGOLADZ tomorrow


Apr 24

A bit too blandly and with lack of reference to the symmetric (as well as, in fact, the reflexive) property, Why aren’t women equal?  Women aren’t equal but they ARE getting 'equal-er.'

Siblings, like spouses, are occasionally natural rivals. No matter how kindred, no one is identical and souls and stars aren’t always aligned. 

I no longer have a brother but my sisters still do (in me).

A bit more about my early relationship with my closer-in-age sister, Bonnie (who, as mentioned yesterday, instructed me in toilet paper procedures).  Bon was born slightly more than 2 years before me.  She was the apple of my grandfather’s (dziadzia, my mom’s dad as my dad’s father had died in an industrial accident 20 years earlier) eye, supposedly because she was a mała busia ([mow-ee boo-shah], or young person who reminded him of his wife, my grandmother).  When I was born, she was feeling demoted from being the baby of the family.  Dziadzia asked her how she liked her baby brother and she asked him to take me back to the hospital he had to backtrack and convince her to give me a chance.  

She did sort of give me a chance although she did overdose me on St. Joseph’s aspirin for children one summer.  (Not saying this was intentional; as I doubt it was.). I liked the orange taste and one morning she woke me up early and, while I was sitting on a bathroom stool, she fed me about 2 bottles of aspirin.  (This was before Reye’s Syndrome associated with aspirin in children was identified.). Not quite a Prospero and Caliban situation. Fortunately (for me at least), we were discovered and my parents forced me to stay awake, walking in the front lawn, until I got to the ER and had my stomach pumped out. It is conceivable that I could have died then and there and so I personally experienced how easy it would be that there could have been no alternate history which was most of my life. 

Life is precious and fragile—and I continue to be very lucky (even if, perhaps, luck includes the luck to realize that if you seek it, you might find it (luck, that is)…in other words, luck may merely be a state of mind.


You can be anything—or at least continue in that direction. Sadly, there isn’t enough time to do everything, especially because the process and journey to anywhere takes time.

ThreeSibMammaries:

As mentioned, I was the third of 4 sibs, the youngest (our baby brother, Jim) who died suddenly about 2 years ago. 

Jim and I were very close growing up; partners in crime and creative destruction.  For Christmas one year, we received these really cool electric metal trolleys (before things were ‘cheap’ and ‘made in Japan’) that ran on a flexible plastic track that you could put where you wanted. You turned them on and they flashed lights and whistled while they went on the track. When they got to the end of the track, they automatically reversed directions back and forth. We ‘tied up’ the small hallway in our house, tying the doors to bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen. Soon thereafter one of them broke and we took it apart to, unsuccessfully, try to fix it—never able to use them again. We also got young boys tool kits with small hammers, pliers and screwdrivers. (We usually each got the same gifts with something for us individually as well).  We hammered nails and screwed screws into the drawers of our parents small but quaint dresser (which had glass shelves in the middle between the two small banks of drawers with a cool skeleton key hole shaped mirror on the back (like a cartoon of vanity). Our parents were upset but forgiving, living for years with the dresser that we had marred. 

The younger of my two sisters (Bonnie), who was about 2 years older than me, and I were fairly close. She was older than me by years and some of those things which age differently by gender (dating, for example; her boyfriend Chuck P, who was very easy to really like)).  She and I were bookend years in high school. She sort of advised and protected me. She is also the main reason that I didn’t attend the parochial high school that I was registered to attend (next step to the priesthood and all) because she denigrated it compared to the local public high school from which I graduated 50 years ago this summer. Interestingly, she also left our parochial grade school at grade 6 (Thanks Sister unMerry HemmorrhoidFace) to finish in the local public school (Lafayette) whereas Jim and I spent all 8 years at St Adalbert, the same grade school that my mom attended. I remember Jim and I got Bonnie ‘talked to’ by our dad when once she got angry with us and shockingly shouted up the stairs that we were “fucked up fuckers.”   For some strange reason, Bonnie also told me (verbally, procedurally)  how to use toilet paper for butt wiping post poop…take two connected, fold, wipe with one side, fold in half, wipe, fold, wipe, fold…until nothing left, break through or dirty fingers.



Here’s to the delayed recognition of the things we blame for happening to us which, in actuality, happened for us.

There is so little I actually know, though I am learning a lot every day. 

I had one brother, Jim, who was the youngest of the 4 of us sibs.  We were 13 months apart (separated by a month longer than what I think is called ‘Irish Twins’).  We were very close best friends until I went to high school and then other places without our co-location as I slowly continued, admittedly unintentionally, to hive off from him—and we slowly differentiated. Enlisting in the navy was probably the most significant initial separation  and differentiation.  We never really reconnected anywhere near the closeness of our youth.

Amended From BRB: 
Like most close in age brothers, Jim and I were, almost twin-like, inseparable. At times, however, I strain to call up shared memories.
I suspect this is because our senses of selfhood were intertwined, that we were bound up in a "you" and an "us" and a "we" that hardened into a singular entity over early time that devolved into cleaved separateness united only by intimately desired reconnection which could never be complete. What I do know is that many, relatives and otherwise, made us out to be opposites, good and bad, feminine and masculine, academic and unruly. Perhaps they were simply pointing out the parts of us that bifurcated, in opposition to our drive to enact a sameness that upset liberal norms of individuation. Maybe its a mere psychosocial fact that the lives of close sibs are labyrinthine, like any other social form. 

Nevertheless, Jim and I were collaborators and accomplices, best friends and sometimes rivals. Which is to say that we too were key architects of the world of care that brought us into being.

Most sadly, he died almost 2 years ago, too young to be that old after our re-annealing of holiday gobble greetings but before our adequate reintegration.

April 20  (420)

Billy-Ray Belcourt in  A HISTORY OF MY BRIEF BODY wrote a more interesting kind of disclaimer like I wrote above: 

If I were to rank my aesthetic concerns, ambiguity would come before veracity. As such, some names and identifying features have been altered. What's more, I marshal the forces of poetry and theory to weave not a linear story, which "memoir" typically denotes, but rather a series of stories and analytical scenes into a composite that exceeds the boundaries of my individual life.

He is an NDN, a gay First Nation person and excellent writer who I discovered because our friends, Les Canadiennes, left ua a few books including the above mentioned.  So they have disseminated/transsemminated some of their culture and kindnesses.

NOTE: NDN is clever onomatopeaic shorthand spelling for Indian, a term that some Native Americans in the United States and some First Nations peoples in Canada use to refer to themselves. 

Like many other oppressed people, NDNs were oppressed and surpressed, which is becoming increasingly recognized and explored.

With no offense meant, and perhaps overgenerLizing, Canada is like the Liverpool of North America in that they augment the english with the longg 'o' (oo) sound.

April 19

Wouch!  "Wouch" is my neologism for the day to represent an initially surprising event that is either mostly significantly painful or so obviously painful to someone else that you sense the pain which quickly overtakes and supercedes the surprise.  I created this term today when I discovered that the latest interim CEO of SEAGEN earned about $1 million per day. SEAGEN was just bought by Pfizer, who I think significantly overpaid but as mentioned yesterday, they are rolling in COVID money.

What a surprisingly painful situation that is, crazy money which will ultimately be paid by taxpayers.

Otherwise, today was another very good day.  Our guests left, hopefully to return to Regina--a possibility but not definite due to up to 30 cm or more of snow. It was a special, great trip--marathon, sports, touring, chats, including about James Joyce.

On top of that, we had another fine VargoLADZ stream, with bhelgator and Donnie joining us.  Topics included the "binary dichotomy" of binary vs non-binary, a bit on gender pronouns and sone MVP discussion (mine being about the power of social connectedness).  A lot of pleasant and provocative banter was shared and volleyed across the virtual aisles and nets.

I just discovered this interesting book today:

Tyranny from Plato to Trump: Fools, Sycophants, and Citizens by Andrew Fiala

Power grabs, partisan stand-offs, propaganda, and riots make for tantalizing fiction, but what do we do when that drama becomes a reality all around us? For a country founded as an escape from British tyranny, the United States seems to have devolved into a land where tyrants rise to power, sycophants blindly follow, and the entire nation suffers.As ancient Greek philosophers warned us, chaotic tragedy unfolds in the absence of reason, and the only cure is a return to wisdom and virtue. America’s founding fathers knew this lesson all too well and dreamed of an enlightened citizenry guided by better-than-ideological dictators. Using contemporary events to illuminate universal human weaknesses, Andrew Fiala charts the perennial history of tyrannical takeovers and the masses who support them and ultimately suffer under their rule. Ultimately, Fiala also points to a solution. Knowing the cyclical nature of tyranny, we can build safeguards against our worst inclinations and keep alive the freedoms our founding fathers envisioned for this.


This was worth saying, despite my quip below:


Not everything that should be said can be said; Not everything that can be said should be said.

We are the tops…

The unexamined life may not be worth living (according to Socrates) 
but I must add that the examined life isn’t necessarily the be all and end all, either. 

Pfizer is the first pharma company to post >$100BILLION in revenue (last year)!!!  Mostly, admittedly due to wise and successful investments in COVID treatments, but still!!!  Even though I worked for Pfizer and it is a good company, somehow we have to reign in medical costs.  On a flip side of sorts, almost 1 million US nurses will leave nursing by 2027.  That isn't sustainable either.

An old Cherokee told his grandson, “My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all.”

“One is Evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies and ego. 

The other is Good. It is joy, peace,love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy, and truth.”

The boy thought about it, and asked, “Grandfather, which wolf wins?”

The old man quietly replied, “The one you feed.”

The The Hopkington to Boston (by way of Newton) Marathon is practically done for us.  Julia recently finished ~9111th in under 3 hours and 20 minutes--which was her goal.

It was a cool rainy day and before the race was run, it was described as good conditions to run.  After the race they, the psyche out is done and the talk is now how the runners ran well DESPITE the poor weather conditions.

Kenyans won both the male and female races.  Kipchoge though did not do as well as everyone thought--coning in sixth instead of first.

Overall there was a long stream of runners who went by and even at mile 19 aound us, they almost universally looked like they were keeping goodtime and running without too much difficulty.

Hopefully next year, Win and Alex can be with is to enjoy the event.  

Other than Julia and Jamie, we had no other visitors.  Margie has been shuttling them into Boston for the race, which is complicated a bit by our road being closed for the run.  She has been, as she usually is, a wonderful, attentive, host.  Anyone staying here is lucky...and spoiled.

April 16

Tomorrow will be a very busy day at Castillo Vargo.

Not only will our road be blocked off so that the marathon can be run safely in front of us, we also need to get our guests into town--one (Julia) by 7:30 so that she can take the bus 26.2 miles to Hopkington to run the race and the second (Jamie) into town after Julia runs by our house so that Jamie can meet Julia somewhere near the finish line.  Julia's sister-in-law is also running the marathon and her accompanying 5 or 6 people might spend some time with us as well.

Julia and Jamie are both professors at the University of Regina.  Julia is on staff in kinesiology and below is a link to her discussing this run:

https://youtu.be/BN5eQ0w7KNE

About 30,000 people will run the marathon, including the likely first place male (named, I think Kipchoge) who will probably run it in just over 2 hours.  One of his goals is to run a marathon in under 2 hours but Julia, who is on top of these things, doesn't think this will happen tomorrow.  Although the temperature should be conducive, it will probably rain tomorrow which will likely slow it down. 
I think Kipchoge has a great expression when asked what his next running goal: "I only chase one rabbit at a time."   There's a lesson there for us all.  

There was also an official marathon dog, a golden retriever named Spencer who went viral in 2018 due to a video of him at the side of the road with marathon flags in his mouth.  Spencer died a few months ago and there have been memorials for him this year, too.  Here is a picture of Spencer (and his sister Penny, who died even more recently):

Rest in peace, sweet doggies.  Thank you for your faithful service.


It is mildly interesting to me how we clump to simplify things.  It should really be called 'The Hopkington to Boston (by way of Newton) Marathon," but no one does.

I hope it is a great, safe and successful day for everyone.




April 15

Today is the 10th anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombing. Win, Margie and I lived in the Boston area when that happened and it was a terrifying, unreal week. Margie had been at the site of the first bomb the day before it went off and Boston was essentially on lockdown (sheltering in place) all week. I was concerned about Win because I didn't at first know where he was. He kindly fairly quickly confirmed he was OK, which is a thoughtfulness I hope people generally do.  

It is still a tearful remembrance, especially poignant on a day like today.

The bombing changed Boston and affected us in many ways. Even though all things considered, the number of lives lost and the destruction was relatively minor compared to bombings in other areas (including of course the WTC on 911), Boston lost its immunity and sense of safety. Boston became militarized and the police were the celebrated heroes.

There is quite a well-done movie about the event called "Patriot's Day" by Boston's own Mark Wahlberg.  We will watch it tomorrow with friends who are staying with us and who will run the marathon on Monday. 

Patriots' Day is the April mid-month Monday when the marathon is run. It is a Massachusetts state holiday and frequently, including this year delays tax day until the day after. 

Here's to all patriots, veterans and doers of good deeds, including the health care staff and service staff that helped all of us get through the pandemic. 

Most people are good.

“Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.”
-Arthur Shopenhauer


Julia Totosy and friend arrive today to stay with us for a few days so that Julia can run the Boston Marathon on Monday.

Continuing a bit on the theme of Cat-licks from yesterday, many good cathlic boys, especially those who went to parochial schools (as was and did I), grew up wanting to become priests.  A son becoming a priest was the easiest ticket for cathlick parents to get into heaven, it was better than 'don't cross go,' more like chutes and ladders directly into the welcoming and loving arms of God the father, bypassing St Pete at the gates.  Planning to be a priest was the pride of all catholic parents and the boast of families. I was interested in becoming a priest for quite a while and much longer than most, even after high school, even visiting a few seminaries to check out the life a bit.  But some seminarians were weird and not what I would consider holy.  Some seemed to be running from pregnancy scares (as if becoming a priest would curb your lusts or something--we all see how well that went), some were malicious maybe trying to atone for misdeeds of the past (one of the guys told me that when he and his friends were doing LSD, he would buy burning hot pizza and convince then that it wasn't hot and to eat it quickly so that they would burn their tongues and the roofs of their months on the molten cheese--I'm telling you so really weird stuff. And, of course. there were the sexual perverts and deviates.  I'll talk about them later too.


Remember too that I was kind of poor and wanted to get a good higher education--wide ranging but including arts, sciences and philosophy (which I guess I ultimately accomplished). The priesthood was a good way to get a good to great education (albeit for the price of your soul and eternal frustration).  This was very true when I was young and certainly true in the medieval period where priests were god's juniors on earth, pretty much unquestioned despite whatever peccadillos they had.

And for poor women, getting they to a nunnery was one of the few ways they could avoid the trap of marriage, constant pregnancy and being someone's sexual release.  Sadly that was about as good as it got for women.  They were free from marriage, pregnancy and unwanted porking but as free as slaves who were repressed handmaids of the lord, never taken to bed by the bridegroom. And they had to turn the other way when the priests diddled where they shouldn't. The gift/curse that life is generally quite a long time was tough for the religious because the spirit could sublimate for so long but then the rest of life as a repressed servant was tough, too. 

I had nuns as teachers at St Doofus and the Bleeding Fuckin Heart, the parochial grade school I attended.  For the most part, they were bitter with a whiff of BenGay and Vicks Vapo-Rub mixed with the stench of self important entitlement.  And they did some really mean and cruel things to some of the students, too.  Smack their heads against the radiators, make them lick cacti, and, probably most bothersome, they use to have their favorites female students sit at their feet while they were teaching the class and have them scratch and pic their festering leg wounds (which they probably got from when they whipped themselves with palm trees before Easter).

It was a sick situation but you can see why, as mentioned recently...men beat their wives and both beat their kids and nobody did anything about it.  Priests abused whomever they wanted, including the nuns and the priests and nuns took it out on the kids because they could.  Parents rarely believed you if you shared some of the ugly things they were doing.  Sometimes parents would punish you for bringing it up and/or accuse you of causing it to happen.  My parents were never than way, I must say.

So for me personally, the prominence of religion (especially Catholicism) has diministed quite a bit.  The same has been true of societies for the past several hundred years. I am a bit ashamed to realize that I was not a more open minded inquisitive questioner over a large part of my life.  I am utterly amazed that many historically did this.

As Matthew Arnold wrote in Dover Beach (on of my many favorite poems, slightly truncated):

The eternal note of sadness …

The Sea of Faith

once at the full, 

round earth's shore Lay  

like the folds of a bright girdle furled.

But now only 

melancholy, long, withdrawing,

Retreating to the night-wind,

And naked shingles of the world.

---





On a little lighter more intiniate side, as we'd recently talked about partners, consider this interesting quote from Ulysses:

"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me" 


or this tender song by Neil Diamond:

"Is this everything?
If so, was this the only everything ever?"
--DV


On Cathlicism (as promised):

I grew up in a lower middle class conservative Catholic family in the midwestern USA during the boom years post WWII, pre Vatican II and pre evangelicism.
The Catholicism I grew up in was a lot like global Catholicism, I think...certainly what I think of Irish Catholicism from my readings (especially Joyce, Eugene O'Neill (Irish American) and Bruce Springsteen (Irish-Italian-Dutch-American)).  It as a cathlicism of male dominance, especially priestly 'lordship' as vicars of Christ, subservience of women (nuns as handmaids to the lord), very confusing sexual repression and guilt connected with forbidden contraception and absolute rejection of abortion often resulting in very large families with babies every year until the uterus wore out, wife and child beating at which people just looked the other way because that was just the way it was and it was none of your business, alcoholism (for everyone, though in general the alcoholism more of a man thing), depression, restriction and sadness. Reading Joyce, especially POTA and Ulysses gives me the sense that, like me, he struggled with Catholicism although he was better able than I to overtly at least recover and move on  from this other (besides history) "nightmare from which I am trying to awake."   Or, from Finnegans Wake: “He is cured by faith who is sick of fate.”

This cathlicism, the one true and apostolic faith of our fathers,  got deep under your skin and was so fat soluble that it would never really leave until your dead corpse was cremated (which was also not allowed because it would interfere with the 'resurrection on the third day").  You couldn't 'do a GOOP' and consciously uncouple from cathlicism.  Even if you realized you couldn't support the positions of the church (on gays, women's rights, abortion, etc.), it was difficult, bordering on impossible, to think of yourself as the non-catholic (and, at most 'merely' spiritual, at least agnostic, but non-religious).  You still try to see if others you somehow admire are 'also Catholic' so that you can feel that invisible bond with them.  Your default is that you are catholic, even if you consciously know that you are not.

“Once a Catholic, always a Catholic,” as Bruce Springsteen said.  “I don’t participate in my religion but I know somewhere… deep inside… I’m still on the team.” 

It was a cathlicism of learning the rules, suffering to follow them (even in some ways 'glorying' in the suffering of the path), to try to please a god that noone really knew or could figure out--not unlike children of an alcoholic father.  It was not really a happy religion but rather one of going to church because otherwise you'd go to hell; going to mass and communion of at least 9 sequential first Fridays and first Saturdays (of sequential months) in the hope/belief that somehow Mary or someone would make sure you were heaven-ready when you died.  It was a time of prayers every morning and every evening; rosaries, incense and gothic spookiness.  It was not an especially happy religion but it was an indoctrination in the superiority of believing that you were of the 'true believers' and that everyone else was probably going to hell.  Our God may not have been a god of wrath (that god belonged to the jews and 'other' heathens (of course I don't mean jews were heathens (and i'm not really sure what a heathen or pagan was anyway)  but it was the prevailing view of the catholics) but he wasn't a friendly loving god that you wanted to hang out with or have watching over you.  This was the 'cleaver' god...the god who was carefully watching each one of us and the unclear but rigid path he set for us, just waiting for one of us to 'color outside his lines' so that he could have the fun of chopping us to bits with his cleaver, as fun for him and as a warning to every other confused, fearful follower.

It was a time of Purgatory (a place where the unbaptised babies went, never understanding how or why or what was fair about that)...and Saint Christopher, later de-canonized or something into 'Mr. Christopher,' still a good guy and helper of travelers, but no longer a saint (for some reason I never really understood-->was he found out to be a predator so he had to be demoted?  In general, the goal was to BE canonized to be a saint so I've never really understood why they went through the unnecessary effort to demote this guy from the third century--I'll bet he's in non-existent purgatory now, too).


in other words, to flip Charles Dickens:  It was the worst of religions in the worse of religions.


NOTE: A very long ago, in an earlier century, one of my sisters acted what might be considered anti-Cathollic (and certainly rebellious) and as a consequence, my mom 'demoted' her to 'non-sister' for a few years while she was living away from the family.  That is all past now but it was a scary period when you knew your mom could simply wish away (by edict) your existence and connection.


So, in honor of the catholicism of my milieu, I would like to share a link to the following song by Johnny Rivers, aptly perhaps named "Muddy River."

April 12, post VARGOLADS.  Thanks to Donnie and Italianmafia for joining us.

Concerning mothers, although I don't entirely agree with this interesting quote from A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I do think that it generally applies:
"Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother’s love is not."


...and now a message about brotherhood of sorts:

We are not helpless, we are men...
All are strangers,
All are friends,
All are brothers:

https://youtu.be/veQxK8bV7cs

(Stephen Stills, We are not helpless).



Aprill 11--Note that as of 11 AM today, I altered yesterdays entry a bit as well.

From nothing to nothing and the nothingness in between...

I don’t believe in the impossible (except conceptually)

O Fortune, you are fickle as the moon, always waxing and waning;
this miserable life first wrecks, then cures at a whim; 
poverty and power melt like ice. 
Fate, you monster of emptiness, you malevolent whirling wheel- 
happiness is in vain, and always fades away.
   Orff’s Carmina



…To quote Samuel Beckett: "Thats how it is on this bitch of an earth"


and, per Bruce Springsteen, With Every Wish:

These days I sit around and laugh
At the many rivers I've crossed
But on the far banks there's always another forest
Where a man can get lost
Well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides
Guiding us 'cross to another river on the other side
And there someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes
And though my heart's grown weary
And more than a little bit shy
Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst
And leave the angels to worry
With every wish (there comes a curse)

My love language is humor and surprise


PhD, GHD’s brother died Easter yesterday In Catania. RIP

So did Logan Roy…and so many people seem to care though in Logan’s case…really???  Get a life.

We often conflate excuse and explanation for cause. Any reasonable, rationale person frequently does this in the ongoing learn (and ideally learn and confirm) iterative process. Very rational, very Humean.  This can be very difficult is times of seismic (even if slow, with jiggly bits) shift.

That is where I am teetering with respect to the active male support of women’s rights, which I call “malefemnism” because I do think men will likely never completely understand what it means for women to be equal. That’s why I call it Malefemnism — because it is a male (and imperfect, ergo the mal—> bad) femnism (incomplete feminism).  I propose that most people agree that men are practically the dominant sex...And, it is unlikely men will ever be so omniscient that they will ever cede to complete parity...that is a bridge just a bit too far.

I consider myself an active supporter and attempted to understand this equality but I admit it is imperfect and in some ways uncomfortable because I’m still a bit insecure in it. Although I came of awareness in the second wave of femnism, I get confused with the “pronoun” titles miss, mrs, Ms. (Of course there’ they/them, etc., but that largely a different though similar story entirely.)

I was very close to my mom growing up and saw her working ALL THE TIME (seemingly) whereas I knew my dad worked hard at his job (and I saw many of the scars and burns he received at work).  But then he came home, did a few jobs as necessary but could relax where my mom never seemed to stop.  That seeming inequity is my early entry into feminism.

The following topics to be elaborated on over the next few days: Malefemnism, con/tra/ception, the lowerarchy and Catholicism in context

More on mom: 
1. although they weren't called such at the time, mom's "love languages" were service, deprivation and sacrifice
2. her main nutrition group was caffeinated beverages: hot lipton (or cheaper) teabag tea in the morning and one  16 oz bottle of pop at a time  which she had us buy from from Wiltz, local store, to which we would walk for her, usually alone.

THE ORIGIN OF LAUGHTER by John Updike
(after Desmond Morris)

Hunched in the dark beneath his mother's heart, 
The fetus sleeps and listens; dropped into light, 
He seeks to lean his ear against the breast 
Where the known rhythm holds its secret pace.



Slowly, slowly, through blizzards of dozing, 
A face is gathered, starting with the eyes--
At first, quite any face; two painted dots 
On cardboard stir a responsive smile. Soon 
No face but one will serve: the mother's, 
A mist, a cloud that clearly understands.



She teases him, pretends to let him drop.
He wants to cry but knows that she is good.
Out of this sudden mix, this terror rimmed 
With necessary flesh, a laugh is born.





April 7

Although my mom was upper or mid lower class, she grew up in a place, space, culture and time when men beat their wives who then joined them in beating their kids propagating a viscous (in both senses of the term) cycle. (This did not happen to her and us but it happened all around us and no-one did anything about it.). This was a time when priests preyed on parochial students (which I know from personal experience).
There was definitely a double standard—a situation I am afraid we may be returning to with a razor thin political divide that even though it is about equally women, the women on each side seem to think (or don’t think) differently—especially when it comes to women’s rights. (As I write this, a Texas federal judge is halting the FDA approval of abortion pill mifepristone and Roe v Wade was recently overturned).  Her father “allowed” her to go to high school even though his mates mocked him for wasting education on a girl. So her way out, was to get married (and work). 
  She did get married and had 4 kids: 2 older girls and then 2 boys, me being the older son. My mom remarked at how attentive my dad was to her while she was in the hospital with the girls but when I was borne he wasn’t. Rather, he was out calling all family and friends to brag “I have a son!” My dads name was Frank and I was supposed to take that name as a family tradition for the first born male. Instead she named me something different. 

My mom was dutiful but not happy and I think she got increasingly depressed as she felt trapped in her increasingly constricted situation.   I know that she didn’t enjoy sex (at least that’s what my sister told me. I also know that I wasn’t breast fed, resulting in my brother being born 13 months after me. She slowly stopped taking care of herself, smoking more and drinking (beer) regularly and alone, reminiscent of Picasso’s The Absinthe Drinker.  She cooked for us and was very clean, pinning her hair with Bobby pins every night before work. But she barely ate the food she cooked and seemed to subsist mostly on Pepsi (or Coke), tea with real lemon juice. She also became increasingly isolated, not wanting to see others or even talk on the phone. She went to church religiously (as required) but always stayed in the back of the church. She was a compliant but nominal catholic. 

She didn’t want to socialize or travel but rather stayed at home drinking and smoking later and later into the night.  My dad supplied her booze and ciggies but increasingly stopped being with her during these periods. She became increasingly unhealthy. 

She worked until she had her first small stroke. My dad had retired earlier and he was looking forward to their traveling but that never really happened because of her stroke. She had a nearly fatal stroke while I was out of contact, moving to Chicago from Indianapolis. She spent several months in the hospital and then several years wheelchair bounds, right-side paralyzed and unable to speak. She should have faded away at home but my dad freaked out when she became comatose. I took her to the ER where she was hospitalized, dying of urosepsis a few hours later. She died about 10 months after Alex was borne. Winston never met her. 

I wish life had been much better and more fair to her. I loved her and she deserved so much more. She wanted to be a nurse or a teacher…I’m not sure she wanted to be a parent. I am mostly sad when I think about her life. 


April 6

You can't go home again, said Thomas Wolfe--but you can retrieve the past by writing about it. (Margaret Atwood)

Yesterday I wrote mostly about my dad. Today I will mostly explore my more complex and complicated relationship with my mother

To be at least a good mother must be the hardest of the very common jobs with the largest membership.  On top of everything else every other class of person does, a mother has to use her uterus, vagina and brain not just for pleasure but also for nurturing, maintaining and propagating the species while being inconvenienced, sleep-deprived and semi-(at least)-incapacitated for a duration much beyond the gestational and lactational through to educational, recreational, differentiational,  separational and much beyond.  The job never really ends although it frequently does transmute into a positive bidirectional symbiosis.

And the sons in their lives become especially attentive to and protective of the mother.  I for example once literally left my cousin on the side of the road in Rhode Island when he accused my mother of cheating at cards (canasta) but would not support the accusation with any examples. I mean, c’mon…canasta?

(I guess when it comes to “fightin’ words,” moms can easily defend themselves probably better than we can but “fightin’ words” are really trigger words to provoke confrontation…and I responded.)

As Margaret Atwood also wrote, the pen is mightier than the sword, but only in retrospect: at the time of combat, those with the swords generally win.…and, I add, when push comes to shove, men will do most of the shoving and women will be the ones most pushed around. 


The bond between a mother and her child is even more individualized and unique than is the bond between a mother and her children. i always thought that I was my mom's favorite but so did each of my sibs.

My mom could, and did, ease my cares and fears even if she had to lie (not that anyone would consider her to be a liar, because she wasn’t).  One night when I was about 9 years old, I was night terrorized by the overwhelming knowledge that I was going to die that night.  I came crying uncontrollably to her and she simply said that everything was going to be okay.  I was able to sleep that night and all the nights afterward.  After knee surgery, between confused spasms of returning consciousness, somehow I knew she was there with me, poking me in the back and saying, “mom’s here, mom’s here!”

Overall she was the axis around which my young self revolved into maturity in its comfortable orbit.  As I got older, I started to realize she was an independent person with thoughts, dreams, likes, a history and a societally imposed composition of roles, foibles, demons (image in au pair book shelf) and habits (both positive and self-destructive)…and I wondered why there seemed to differences in the way men and women were treated and the different expectations imposed upon them.  Whereas my dad left home to work all day every weekday, she worked away at various jobs but also seemed to be always working at home as well—cooking, washing, cleaning and so forth.

…to be continued tomorrow,



April 5

In praise of a father.

My dad was a fairly simple though very curious, mostly self-taught guy who loved life, his four kids and naively believed in the power of education. He was also devoted and dedicated to his wife (my mom) taking care of her in his clumsy clunky way after her severe debilitating stroke which, because it’s resulting depression and paranoia, caused her to be angry and mean to him and to openly call the neighbor a bitch for having an affair with him—neither of which were true. In her post stroke angry paranoid confused state, she was physically abusive to him, too, kicking and slapping him. To be fair in very small part he encouraged her to try to hit him with her withered, stroke-shrunken right arm—his best awkward attempts to get her some physical therapy.

Both of my parents were of lower middle class Eastern European, Catholic descent.  My mom's parents were born in Poland and my mom grew up in an American Polish 'ghetto' with Polish being her first and only language (until she went to school at the local parochial grade school {which I also attended}.  My dad's mom was born in America of Polish immigrants and his father was from Hungary.  This was an issue when my dad met my mom's father (dziadzia in Polish) in that my dziadzia was unwilling to meet my dad at first because of his last name (which was Hungarian).  Dziadzia supposedly said that if my dad was not polish, he may as well be a Jew. (I include this only as a reference to my background as mentioned yesterday.)   

Ironically, our last name really isn't hungarian but is probabaly not our real name but an Ellis Island artifact. The was a very unsettling realization when I learned (about 20 years ago) that my identity (at least the identity I associated with the heritage of my last name) was false.

My dad's early circumstances weren’t easy. Being of mixed parents (Polish AND Hungarian), they spoke english in his house and he failed second grade because he couldn’t speak Polish (the laanguage of his parochial school) so he couldn’t really learn or succeed in school. His father died due to an industrial accident at the Studebaker factory which probably ruptured his liver and/or spleen, telling my dad with his dying words that he ‘was now the man of the family,’ and to take care of his mom and his multiple younger siblings.  My dad was 13 at the time so he dropped out of high school to support his mom and his sibs.

He was a gently guy with dreams and desires and the drive for continual self-improvement.  He worked his way up and out including stoking his wanderlust by leaving landlocked northern Indiana and joining the WWII US Navy.  And...he read a lot.

After the navy, he met my mom as they were on separate bowling leagues.  She was attracted to him even though he was kind of from the 'other side of the tracks.'  Although my mom's family was by no means wealthy, my dziadzia was a grocer so they always had food, cigarettes (my mom's vice which contributed to her illnesses) and a car.  My mom always said she had better off suitors but she somehow fell in love with "poor Fxxxx Vzzzz" a comment that always hurt my feelings when she told me.

After leaving the navy and being a married father, although he never graduated from high school, he got his GED and took home study courses in auto mechanics. He took swimming lessons when I was in kindergarten.  I remember going to the natatorium with the younger of my two sisters and our younger brother while he learned to swim.  Although he never went to college, he expected all of his children to get higher degrees because we were 'college material' (as our teachers told him, which made him beam with pride).  He had a continual desire for improvement and betterment and was optimistic to the core.

Because his circumstances were meager, he always worried about money.  I unfortunately picked that up from him too.  Ironically, perhaps, he had a lust and zest for life and didn't want it to end.  He developed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia in his 80's and minimized how it intruded in his life.  He wanted to get a bone marrow transplant in the hopes of being cured but he was too old at the time to justify the risk (according to the doctors---he was willing if it gave him a chance for a cure).

There are many things I picked up from my dad and I cherish:  My own wonderlust, my desire to continue to learn and improve, my getting a college degreee and an MD, my love of swimming and, especially, the love of my sons.  Like in many families, I am sure, my dad was the softie and my mom was the disciplinarian.  I am very grateful to him for all of that.

I also remember when my dad would play with my sons when they were young.  He would get on the floor and play with them in a fun, funny non-pretentious way that reminded me of what a wonderful, acceptable and forgiving father he was to me.

Being an american male from the WW era, he didn't tell us he loved us very much...but we knew he did.

I wish he were stil here because I would value his way of being, his kindness and gentleness and his positivity.


April 4

I had no real experience with Jews growing up except the inappropriate and wrong view of them as alien, untrustworthy, shrewd.  

“Jew” was a noun, adjective and verb. That being said, I was never brought up to think of Jews as Christ Killers.

I have certainly matured in this respect at least.  I went to Brandeis University, Almost married a Jewish Brandeisienne and have many very close Jewish friends.  

In addition, as I have moved to various places, I have probably belonged to 4-5 Jewish Community Centers, primarily to swim in their pools.  This includes my current membership at the JCC of greater Boston (Newton), where I probably swim 6 times a week.  We do wear swim caps like in Woody Allen movies.  Of interest, my current JCC has a lot of really old, crumpled, hunched members so, even though I recently retired, I still feel young in that crowd.  

Tomorrow begins Passover which means the JCC is closed for the next 1 1/2 days for the eight-day Jewish holiday which commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.  In Hebrew Passover is known as Pesach (which means “to pass over”), because God passed over the Jewish homes, saving the Jews, when killing the Egyptian firstborn on the very first Passover eve.

Sadly, in the last year and a half of membership, the JCC has had at least 2 bomb threats…which is unfortunate, frightening and representative of the increasing anti-semitism in most parts of the world, including the USA.

The New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft via his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism—introduced the blue square emoji as a symbol of solidarity with the Jewish people as part of the #StandUpToJewishHate campaign.  I support and endorse this. (As an aside, Robert and his recently deceased first wife, Myrna, were great supporters of Brandeis causes.  He probably still is.)

April 3rd

I just started a new, separate thread holding the pictures from Margie's party, which you can goto if you select the "Vargodl" at the top left of this page.

Today was a further 'returning to our "new" reality--home with an increasing sense of technological home security.  Margie may have mentioned that we had 'bigfoot' apparently come to visit us (aka case the joint) a couple of weeks ago. courtesy of snowfall, we saw his yeti tracks and became concerned about security--we have many windows (although new, secure and casement) and doors which are protective, but wont keep out someone with the need to enter.

Over the past weeks since biggie oggled, we've significantly upgraded our security--now with motion detectors, lights, videocameras, sirens as well as central monitoring (re-initiated) and non-denomininational space lasers which remotely inject Bill Gates' most uptodate-but excruciatingly painful, GPS tracking chips into the buttocks (and, in fact, the bollocks, if they are present) of unwanted uninvited visitors.

Security is important especially as we occasionally leave our kitties over night though we have the capability to see them on the little remote screen now.

We are very fortunate to have some nice stuff and live in one of the safest places around Boston.  Nonetheless, "some nice stuff" sometimes attracts the riff and the raff.  But we don't want to be owned by our possessions.

2 April

Recently back from NYC and a quick but very pleasant and (if I might say so) very successful surprise weekend for Margie. I am so very grateful for all who came to the city to share. It was inconvenient for everyone but I think everyone had a great time and would do it again. I am so especially grateful to Winston for helping to make it happen. 

Margie and I love each other very much and made the new vow to "never not" love each other.

1 April--April Enchantment (instead of Fools) Day

A wonderful surprise for my fantastic wife. 

Dinner with dear friends Pauline, Louie, Kevin, Abdu, Joanne, Jess, Rich, Stephanie, Stuart as well as Win (who was instrumental in planning and arranging) at Emilio's Balotto in NYC. 

As Scott Galloway says, Life is so rich!

And...as has been increasingly stated, close friends are very important to health and longevity. 

We are blessed with wonderful friends. 

...And, I dearly love my wife. I surprised her today for the wonderful person she is and the important 10 year milestones she has crossed. She similarly surprised me a week ago with a surprise retirement dinner--an ouroboros of surprises. Like "The Gift of the Magi"
by O. Henry. 

Life is so Rich!!!


31 March

I began yesterday with "Expect surprises!" because I like the implied conflict of expecting the unexpected. 

Tomorrow is what many consider April Fools Day but, taking off on the surprise theme, I'd like to advise everyone to expect enchantments--positive surprises!

30 March


"Expect surprises!"  an optimistic oxymoronicum.


BREAKING somewhat interesting national news bits from this pm:

1.) Donny Trump indicted in NY.

2.) The main GOOPette found not guilty for skiing accident in Utah.


...continuing clangingly on the last two onomatapoeiae of kiss and suck:

Lips and anus as extrusions/extensions/extremes of the alimentary canal in humans. Do other animals have or do only humans have protruded lips?  like the anus, the lips are the ends of the alimentary canal which pucker externally.   Animals greet with their noses and tongues but dont 'kiss'.  ...and human kissing is generally an intimate activity.

Many years ago (probably 50, give or take), I drew a self-portrait with puckered lips, remarking the similarity to the anus (maybe it's just me?).  I'll see if i can find that drawing and enter it in a later posting.

A further irony/paradox is that animals (including humans) are tubes within tubes—really ‘outside in’ via the alimentary canal… lips connect anus with a tract (GI) which takes in food and water, extracts what the body needs, excreting the rest/waste.  Food from the outside stays outside the body (in the GI tract as it passes through the body). What passes through the GI tract never ‘enters’ the body. 

Burps, borborygmi and flati are manifestations of the gaseous passengers of the GI tract.

Farts (flati,flatulence) are the funniest though potentially most disconcerting of the three.  Butt they certainly are funny and the stuff of (mostly lowbrow) literature.  Salvador Dali wrote an essay on maiden or virgin farts.  An uncontrolled irregular semi-survey by me suggests that men fart more and louder than do women.  Men BRAAPPP, women 'pert' or 'pweet,' sometimes without even realizing it.

Farts are funny

Farts are fun

Percolating softly 

or rumbling on

  [by me, DV]


“Because of a very long fart, really a very long and, let us be frank, melodious fart, that I produced when I woke up, I was reminded of Michel de Montaigne. This author reports that Saint Augustine was a famous farter who succeeded in playing entire scores.”

Excerpt from Diary of a Genius by Salvador Dali

"Jar of Farts" From Dali's illustration based on the novel; "The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Renowned Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes” by François Rabelais.

...and James Joyce wrote privately to Nora about her gas:
“You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night.”

Torque is energy in a twisting motion, which is measured in pound-feet. In another 'n of 1' uncontrolled approximation, I estimate that when farts are torqued into solids (gas is turned into poo-poo, aka shite), the solid excrement also has a pound-foot measure but in this case one shit-foot weighs about one pound avoirdupoisd.  Isn't science amazing?!!!

streaming with https://www.twitch.tv/vargolads this evening (and most Wednesday evenings) at 6 PM.

More of 'the similar other act' of JJ's APOTA (James Joyce's A Portrait Of The Artist).  The other end/act compared to Kiss of yesterday being "Suck".

  "Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.

  To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing."

...and, clanging on 'suck,' the following quote on Suck sess:

Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Robert Collier


28 March

A day without James Joyce, who ’turned his mind to unknown arts,’ is a day without insightful creative thought. 

F'r'instance, Deshil Commodius Eamus which could, i suppose mean 'The Shield of Commonwealth Amuses.'

Our Commonwealth house (Castillo Vargo) is a very very very fine house with…two cats...
…a bonded feral Siamese rescue pair  [But, as has been previously opined and even bumper stuck, who rescued whom?]

Being a James Joyce fan, I was planning to call them James and Joyce

Being a happily married James Joyce fan, WE call them Leopold and Livia (Leo and Livie).

I am going to call my next pet “Peeves” so I can introduce my friends to ‘my pet peeves.’  Peeves will probably be a turtle, or a unwanted mouse…Slow, dirty, irritating, maybe even infectious (salmonella, rickettsia, ohmygodosis...you name it).  Of course, cats can be fairly peevishly self-possessed and stand-off-ish, too.  Some might consider than part of their allure.

Some of my favourite early Joyce (and first onomatopoeia of 'kiss'), is from A Portrait: "What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?"

Monday, March 27

There is a best (at least in an Anselmian sense). My goal…the beginning of my morning ‘praymeditation’ is to ‘be better for the best!’

Mom101: Today would have been my mother’s 101st birthday.  Happy birthday, Alycce!

The pandemic ended up being an ~ 3 year transition into retirement for me. The whole of 2023 will be, in many ways, the transition into retirement. Had the pandemic not happened, I would have (and could have) retired much earlier. But, working from home, it was convenient to work, AND my wonderful wife made sure I was fed, watered and following safe Covid practices. Overall, especially the last almost 2 years, although I would have preferred no pandemic and although the precautions and isolation were not insignificantly inconvenient, the pandemic period had upsides—regular (and enhanced) reading and swimming, f’r’instance.
It is interesting how some friendships seem to have paused during the pandemic and some have frayed. 

Philosophically and absolutely I non-despondently ponder if there is even the possibility of nothing?


You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Optimists look for the luck in the opportunity
I have been lucky because that is how I've wanted to be

Innominal Patriotism is Filling and Spiritually Sanctifying

Bless us alone with Theseus’ gifts
and
Gift us, this day, our daily
bread
Upon which man doth not alone
live


‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.’”​ — Anthony de Mello​

My last day of employment...at Akebia.  A good run at a great company.
Now it's time to cast off into a new fruitful and creative endeavors.

Got a hold on me...
